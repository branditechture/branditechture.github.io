										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The MIME type error can happen when you attempt to hotlink a JavaScript file hosted on GitHub in your <code>&lt;script src=""&gt;</code>¬†tag. GitHub has explicitly disabled JavaScript hotlinking, and newer versions of browsers respect that setting.</p>
<p>In the year 2013, <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> started using <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code>, which instructs modern browsers to enforce strict <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIME type</a> checking. For browsers that honour this setting, they would be unable to parse or process the file as intended, instead, they return the raw files as is.</p>
<p>In other words, you&#8217;ll find an error in your console, similar to what is shown below;</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Refused to execute https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/branch/path/file.js as script because "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff" was given and its Content-Type is not a script MIME type.</code></pre>
<p>To permanently solve this problem, follow the <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jsdelivr</a> CDN workaround below;</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the file you are linking to on GitHub, and click to the &#8220;Raw&#8221; version.</li>
<li>Copy the URL.</li>
<li>Replace¬†<code>raw.githubusercontent.com</code> with¬†<code>cdn.jsdelivr.net</code></li>
<li>Add¬†<code>/gh/</code>¬†just before your username.</li>
<li>Remove the <code>branch</code> name.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an illustration;</p>
<p>From</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src="http://raw.githubusercontent.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;/path/to/file.js"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>to üëáüèΩ</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/path/to/file.js"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CryptoTab is a modified version of the popular Chrome Browser. The browser¬†is also powered by Chromium ‚Äì which is the same engine that Google Chrome Browsers run on. The Browser looks and feels almost identical to the famous Chrome Browser. In fact, the same Chrome extensions can be installed on the CryptoTab Browser.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of the time of this writing, The software (i.e. CryptoTab Browser) is available for Windows and macOS. It is also available for iOS and Android devices.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<p>Click <a class="extlink" href="https://cryptobrowser.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HERE</a> to Visit CryptoTab&#8217;s Download Page.</p>

<h2>Why was CryptoTab Developed?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since the invention of Blockchain Technology, and the creation of the first Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), a special set of people known as miners has remained crucial for the authentication and addition of new blocks to the blockchains. And the key motivator of these miners has always been fat rewards (given in form of cryptocurrencies) whenever they successfully mine a block first. However, mining blocks for a blockchain is no small task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the cryptographic nature of blockchains ‚Äì which requires machines to perform very complicated and difficult computations ‚Äì it required very powerful machines. But as the number of miners in the networks increased, the probability of being the first to validate a block became increasingly difficult, which meant individual miners began to find it next to impossible to mine blocks ‚Äì especially those who do not have powerful machines. But then CryptoTab creators came up with an ingenious idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By integrating a special Proof of Work algorithm called CryptoNight into the CryptoTab Browser, they were able to aggregate the resources (i.e. Processing Power) of several machines (Smart Phones, Personal Computers, Tablets, etc.) which had the Browser installed to mine Monero Privacy Coins and reward each individual who agreed to contribute to the success by installing the CryptoTab Browser. Though the Monero Privacy Coins are first converted to Bitcoins before being paid to the miners (i.e. Users of CryptoTab Browser).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was essentially a way to enable anyone, with any device to mine Cryptocurrencies ‚Äì cheaply&#8230;at least, that was the message that was pushed by the creators of CrytpoTab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CryptoTab browsers are supposed to enable less powerful machines to mine Cryptocurrencies without slowing down their operation or performance. Though, the Miner also has the option to increase the mining speed, by increasing the number of resources allocated to the Browser (although doing this could slowdown devices, and drain batteries quickly).</span></p>
<h2><b>Is CryptoTab Browser Safe?</b></h2>
<p>CryptoTab comes in two variants; The free (ordinary) browser and the paid (Pro) version (which costs about $2.50 as of the time of this writing). Being available in the Google PlayStore, and Apple Store, the App is most likely free from viruses and isn‚Äôt particularly harmful to devices. Though, you should exercise caution when downloading the software from any third-party website, in order not to download an infected software</p>
<p><strong>Also Read:<a href="https://branditechture.com/is-nicehash-worth-it/"> Is NiceHash Worth It?</a></strong></p>
<h2><b>Benefits Of CryptoTab</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, users of the CryptoTab browser don‚Äôt have to do anything out of the ordinary. They would simply have to install the browser, and earn Bitcoins for using the browser (to surf the internet, stream videos, or just let it run in the background&#8230;).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, users can decide to leverage the Affiliate program CryptoTab provides to multiply their earnings. In this case, all a user has to do is invite other people to use the CryptoTab browser. From then, a certain percent of the coins mined by their referrals (up to 10 steps deep) would also be paid to them ‚Äì providing a sort of passive income for the person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, on paper, the perks of using the CryptoTab browser includes</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy, and comfortable user interface: Since the User Interface is similar to that of the Chrome browser, users (who already enjoy using Chrome) would not find it difficult to switch to the new browser.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides cheap mining opportunities. This is because users do not have to pay for powerful machines or set up mining Rigs in other to mine cryptocurrencies.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mining process doesn‚Äôt slow down the devices either: According to the creators, the browser only makes use of ‚Äúunused‚Äù resources in the device.¬†¬†</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also easy to set up: The heavy lifting ‚Äì like, the mining algorithms, setup, etc. ‚Äì has already been taken care of. All a user needs to do is register an account, and activate the mining. Once they generate sufficient funds (which is at least 0.00001 BTC), they can easily transfer them to their wallet.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Large Community: The official website of CryptoTab states that there are more than 25 million users around the globe. And considering the browser has been around for a while, you can easily find answers to a lot of your questions easily on the internet.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Of Bitcoins For Payment: CryptoTab pays in a popular cryptocurrency ‚Äì i.e. Bitcoin ‚Äì making it easy for users to withdraw the coins into their wallets and easily make use of it without needing to convert it first¬†</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Referral/Affiliate Program: The referral program provides users the possibility of earning passively. The referral program is also legal, and well structured.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is not only great reviews with this App.¬†</span></p>
<h2><b>CryptoTab Reviews</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One notorious complaint is that the earning potentials are too small, and takes way too long. In essence, although it provides easy, stress-free earrings, it won‚Äôt necessarily make you rich. To counter this limitation, there are options to buy Cloud Boosts packs, which then increase the mining speeds. And some others take to installing the CryptoTab across multiple devices at once in order to multiply their earnings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the reviews online, and the few people I‚Äôve come in contact with, CryptoTab really does payout; however, the people crushing it on the platform are those who are great at recruiting new users. In fact, this very option is pushed so much so that you are promised bonuses such as a free 2X boost (in mining speed) if you refer 2 users.</span></p>
<h2><b>Does CryptoTab Really Mine Bitcoin?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I took a deeper look into the browser, I realized that it didn‚Äôt really seem to use the device resources for the mining process.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I figured this out by juxtaposing two distinct smartphones. When I did this, I noticed that both smartphones with very different specs (i.e. one with very high specs, and another with very low specs) all mined at relatively the same speed.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, even when you turn off the internet connection, the mining just continues ‚Äì as though the whole animation and counting was just a smokescreen, misleading us into believing something is really happening.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also noticed that the mining speed seems to increase when you start referring more and more people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, from observation, I realized that;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was those who were actively recruiting others ‚Äì and earning commissions in the process ‚Äì that was making the most money from CryptoTab (not those with powerful devices)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">CryptoTab also makes a lot of money selling Cloud boosts, to those who wish to mine Bitcoin, but are not great at recruiting. So if you‚Äôre asking, ‚Äúhow does CryptoTab make money?‚Äù there is your answer. Though, the probability of breaking even (i.e. making back your money) from using the Cloud Boosts alone might be precarious.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The browser tries to get as much User Information as possible ‚Äì demanding that they sign up with their Google account, and requests more and more permission from the user‚Äôs Google account, which they‚Äôd have to agree to, or forfeit using the service. And, in case you don‚Äôt know&#8230;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your personal data (after being collected) could be used or sold ‚Äì this is how those annoying Ads manage to follow you around the internet. Though I‚Äôm not saying they sell your information, you should know that they do collect it, and businesses seldom collect what they don‚Äôt use.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Is CryptoTab Legit?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all these observations, one cannot say that CryptoTab is a scam, a Ponzi Scheme, or a Pyramid scheme; but it really does adopt an MLM structure. And whilst most MLM (i.e. Multi-Level Marketing) is not illegal, one should always proceed with caution ‚Äì because they often hide more work than they present upfront.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, you can start earning Bitcoins from CryptoTab, but you should be ready to do more than just downloading and installing the CryptoTab browser.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Quick Overview:</strong> Ever since the invention of Blockchain by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, interest in the technology has steadily risen, particularly towards the opportunities it brought in regards to wealth. At first, early adopters hopped on the opportunity and started making good money from the New Tech by becoming miners for the network and earning commissions. But as more and more people poured into the system, competition would get bloody, and people would start teaming up, and soon things like pools, and consequently, NiceHash would emerge. But, due to high volatility and perilous hacks and thefts, a lot of people are now wary, and super cautious about Startups in the Crypto industry. Hence the question, ‚Äúis NiceHash worth it?‚Äù</span></p>

<h2>What is NiceHash?</h2>
<p>NiceHash is a cryptocurrency<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hash-power-hash-rate" class="extlink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> hash power</a>¬†marketplace that connects sellers of hashing power with buyers of hashing power using the sharing economy approach. The company was founded in Slovenia by Marko Kobal and Matja≈æ ≈†korjanc in the year 2014.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing to understand is the nature of the market NiceHash exists in, and the opportunity they leverage to build their business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is, ever since the invention of Blockchain technology, there has been an increased need for computational power. This is because the current Blockchain framework relies on the ability of a network of computers <strong>to process hashed, and decrypt encrypted data</strong> ‚Äì two tasks that are very difficult and exhaustive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, the Blockchain is a distributed ledger to which anyone in the network has access. However, to maintain the ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù of the Blockchain, some users are tasked to do a certain amount of work in order to verify that any new information that is being inputted into the network is authentic. This demand for work is a way the system uses to deter attackers who might have the wish to alter the records.¬†</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Hashing and Hash Rate?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the sake of security, information (or Blocks) in a Blockchain Network, are not just encrypted ‚Äì i.e. made impossible to be understood by anyone for who the information was not meant for ‚Äì but also hashed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, a piece of encrypted information (or block) can be decrypted using an encryption key. But, this also meant that if the key falls into the wrong hands, all the information (or blocks) is compromised. However, when a hashed block is compromised, only a representation of the information (i.e. a Hash Value) is exposed, and not the information in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that‚Äôs not all. The Hash itself is also very tricky to discover. This is because when a piece of information is hashed, and a hashed version of the information is produced, there is no way of getting back, or guessing, the original information from that hashed information ‚Äì just like you can‚Äôt get back wood from its ash. Hence, it takes a lot of trial and errors to guess the right data that generated that Hashed information. This trial and error are called computation, and until the machine ‚Äúguesses‚Äù the correct hash, the Blockchain network would not accept any new block.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is to say, a Blockchain wraps a piece of encrypted information inside a hash function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why, very powerful computers are usually needed to carry out these iterations ‚Äì which can run into hundreds of very complicated calculations, most times leading to wrong answers.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, the hash rate (of a machine or network) refers to the number of times attempts are made to complete those calculations each and every second. This hash rate is measured in Units of hash per second. Machines with a high hash power are highly efficient and powerful and can process a lot of data in a single second. Hence, more hash rates (aka Computational Power, Processors, GPU, etc.), equals more chances of success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: The process of using Machine Processing Power to validate blocks in a blockchain is also referred to as ‚ÄúProof of Work‚Äù (PoW).</span></p>
<pre><strong>Have you heard about Hive OS? Read;¬†<a href="https://branditechture.com/is-hive-os-worth-it/">Is Hive OS Worth It?</a></strong></pre>
<h2><b>Why Was NiceHash Created?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the nature of the task at hand, miners needed very powerful machines, but they also consumed monstrous amounts of energy in order to carry out these calculations fast. And the problem was, if you are not the first to predict the right hash, and validate the block, then there is no reward for your efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a lot of Blocks to mine, more and more people poured into the Networks, and they all came with their very, very powerful machines ‚Äì some even setting up humongous mining rigs (i.e. very powerful machines that are interconnected for the sole purpose of carrying out a difficult computational task).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, it became extremely improbable to be the one to find hash, or validate the blocks first ‚Äì since much more powerful and faster computers were already in the race.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To counter this, miners started aggregating resources, by forming Pools. That way they were able to have a better chance of being the first to validate more blocks, and also get rewards. This group of miners simply shared the reward according to the amount of computational power each contributed to the Pool.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And remember, since it was getting increasingly difficult to mine, miners were beginning to crave more and more powerful computers to do the mining ‚Äì it was an uphill battle for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But NiceHash had other plans. They wanted to make finding hashes nicer for everyone. Hence the name, NiceHash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creators of NiceHash thought to themselves, ‚Äúwhat if an individual doesn‚Äôt have these powerful machines, and didn‚Äôt even want to dedicate their personal machines to mining; but wanted to mine blocks and be rewarded in cryptocurrencies, how would they do it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, NiceHash came up with an ingenious idea of setting up a sort of ‚Äúshared economy‚Äù and it killed two birds at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side Note: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In economics (particularly capitalism), sharing economy refers to a system in which people with the means to do a job (for a client), offer their services (to that client), and are paid for it. That is to say, it enables the sharing (or proper usage) of excess capacity ‚Äì by giving (the people in need) access to the resources, whilst rewarding the owners of the resources.¬†</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is to say, in a shared economy, Buyers are those who pay for resources (or Capacity), whilst Sellers are those who own the resources (or Capacity).</span></i></p>
<h2><b>How NiceHash Works:¬†</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea (for NiceHash) was simple: Buyers decide on their needs (i.e. the specific coin they wish to mine), pick a Pool (i.e. a group of miners) to mine it, then state the price they are willing to pay the Pool for the job. If the Pool accepts the offer, they go ahead and mine the coin. After which the coin would be handed over to the Buyer, and the Money would be handed over to the Sellers.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This meant, Buyers didn‚Äôt have to have powerful Machines to mine coins anymore, and Miners are assured a fair wage for their powerful computers ‚Äì i.e. their assets. Of course, in all these NiceHash, being the aggregator/platform would charge both Buyers and Sellers a small fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In simple terms; NiceHash serves as an online marketplace for buying and selling of computer processing/hashing power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NiceHash launched in April 2014 and has quickly grown to become the largest hash power marketplace in the world, with more than 170,000 miners, 3.3 million orders served, and over 181,000 BTC paid out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question now is, is it worth Buying or Selling on NiceHash?</span></p>
<h2><b>Is NiceHash Worth It?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Objectively looking at the platform, you will find that it offers a wide range of services and features to make things very easy for both Buyers and Sellers.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of its features include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Compatibility: users do not need dedicated crypto mining hardware because it can utilize the little GPU/CPU/Processing power that their Personal Computers already have. If you own an AMD or Nvidia card, all you need to do is to install the free NiceHash Miner software.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ease of Usage: The service is intuitive and easy to use; This very feature is mostly appreciated by users who are entirely new to crypto mining and trading.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Neat Interface: The simplicity of the User Interface is also commendable. It is uncluttered, comprehensive, and also intuitive. The central dashboard shows you your current mining activities, devices connected, and even your balances, giving you an at-a-glance overview of your portfolio.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial set up: The process of registering, and setting up a NiceHash account is simple, and can be done within 15 minutes</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Anonymity: Sellers don‚Äôt even need to register at all if they prefer to remain anonymous. And Buyers are able to begin ordering hashpower immediately after they register.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Profitability Calculator: The website also includes a profitability calculator. This calculator can help you predict the amount of mining you can practically carry out, hence allowing you to better weigh your options.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Autopilot: After initial setup, the system can pretty much work on its own ‚Äì needing almost no monitoring.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatic Switching: The software also has a brilliant algorithm that automatically determines which coins are worth mining based on their profitability (at a particular time).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick And Easy Exchange: Users can also sell their coins on an integrated exchange that is available on NiceHash, thereby eliminating the need to transfer their funds to an external exchange before carrying out transactions or trading.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Access To Extra hash power: If you have a huge target to hit and need a lot of hashpower, you do not have to get an expensive dedicated machine to do it, as NiceHash enables you to rent additional hash power without needing to upgrade your hardware.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Assorted Pools: Thanks to the popularity of NiceHash, Buyers can easily find a wide range of Pools dedicated to mining several types of coins.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ¬† </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ASIC support: If you have the money to get dedicated mining hardware, you‚Äôd also be glad to know that NiceHash supports it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<h2><b>Other Factors To Consider About NiceHash:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virus Threat: Trying to install the NiceHash software on your Personal Computer will most likely bring up the Virus Threat notification. But this is only because Anti-Virus Programs usually flag CPU mining software like Viruses, due to past histories of Malwares secretly installing CPU miners in order to use people CPU‚Äôs (for mining) without their permission ‚Äì slowing down their devices in the process.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NiceHash Fees: As stated earlier, certain fees are charged for carrying out transactions within the platform (this is what keeps the platform running). To prevent spamming, a fee of 0.0001 BTC is first charged for each transaction, plus 3% of the total amount spent on the order. But for a sale of power, if the balance is less than or above 0.1 BTC, 5%, or 3% are charged respectively. Please note that these fees may change from time to time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NiceHash Affiliate Program: NiceHash also has an Affiliate program available to users. However, you would have to go through rigorous scrutiny before being accepted, and given the materials to work with. Anyway, your potential earnings will be about 5% of all funds generated by the people you invited. There are also bonuses available in the Affiliate program.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<h2><b>How Long Will GPU Mining Be Profitable? (Would NiceHash Be Profitable In 2022, And The Future?)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of Blockchain technology indicates a shift from ‚ÄúProof of Work‚Äù to ‚ÄúProof Of Stake‚Äù. This implies that the major commodity traded on the platform ‚Äì i.e. Hashing Power ‚Äì might be obsolete in the not so far future. The result would be a dramatic decline in demand (Buyers), as well as supply (Sellers). The business model of NiceHash would be effectively dead by then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is still hope. If NiceHash figures out a way to also switch up the commodity being traded ‚Äì i.e. to start selling Stakes, rather than Hashing Power ‚Äì they may still have a chance.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don‚Äôt fret, I think 2022 is still too close&#8230;</span></p>
<h2><b>Is NiceHash Reliable? (My Verdict on NiceHash)</b></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1233 size-full" title="Nicehash Hacked" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nicehash-Hacked.jpg" alt="Nicehash Hacked" width="1000" height="688" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nicehash-Hacked.jpg 1000w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nicehash-Hacked-300x206.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nicehash-Hacked-768x528.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 6th of December, 2017; roughly<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16748472/nicehash-cryptocurrency-mining-bitcoin-ethereum-hacking-security-breach" target="_blank" class="extlink" rel="nofollow noopener"> 63 million US Dollars were stolen from NiceHash‚Äôs account by hackers</a>. Two weeks later, users of NiceHash discovered (to their shock) that Matja≈æ ≈†korjanc (the Company‚Äôs Chief Technology Officer), was once arrested, and imprisoned (for almost 5 years), after committing multiple Cybercrimes ‚Äì including the creation of Mariposa (Aka Butterfly Bot), a virus that infected over 1 million computers (monitoring and stealing passwords, bank credentials, and credit card details).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the news (about the hack and crimes) was beginning to make headlines, the CEO and co-founder of the company, Marko Kobal, resigned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This resulted in a lot of users losing trust in the company ‚Äì and a lot of users are still very cautious to date. Needless to say, the platform offers a lot of benefits, but in a market where things move quickly, and anonymity is common, one needs to thread as though the floor were a layer of thin ice.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the worth of the company is based on your level of experience and needs. That is to say if you are interested in mining and trading cryptocurrencies, but lack experience ‚Äì and just wish to get your feet wet ‚Äì then NiceHash is likely worth your consideration.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who wouldn‚Äôt fancy making $30- $150 per day, without having to negotiate or interact with anyone?¬†Well, I think you do.</p>
<p>Yes, You! ¬†<span style="font-weight: 400;">If that&#8217;s not what lead you to this article, then I can only wonder what else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we get started, let&#8217;s briefly explain what Hive OS is.¬†</span></p>
<h2>What is Hive OS?</h2>
<p>Hive OS is <b>an operating system developed on top of the popular Linux distro, Ubuntu</b>. Let&#8217;s just say that it is a modified version of Ubuntu. Its main mission is to provide you with a convenient interface for mining cryptocurrencies on GPU and managing your rigs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1188" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1188" style="width: 502px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1188 size-full" title="Hive OS App for Android" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_6149.jpg" alt="Hive OS App for Android" width="502" height="960" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_6149.jpg 502w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_6149-157x300.jpg 157w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1188" class="wp-caption-text">Hive OS App for Android, being used to monitor workers.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hive OS gives you the interface to mine Ethereum and Bitcoin, but network<a class="extlink" href="https://hiveos.farm/statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> usage statistics</a> show that over 70% of miners prefer to use Hive OS to mine ETH. Hive OS also has apps for both Android and iOS, and they can be used to monitor and manage your mining rigs remotely.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we would be taking a closer look at the cost of setting up a Hive OS-powered mining rig versus the gains or profits, which leads us to the ultimate question; <strong>Is Hive OS Worth it?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let me tell you about a guy named JP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JP got into cryptocurrency mining at the age of 16, he‚Äôs 23 now and so that‚Äôs about 7 years ago; 2014 to be precise. He and his friend invested their life savings, which was a sum of $100,000 to acquire 100 Ethereum (ETH) miners at the time. They were mining 30 ETH daily. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today‚Äôs economy, that would be worth over a million US dollars per day! Unfortunately, they had to keep reinvesting over 80% of their generated revenue, to foot the cost of operating the miners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, an uninterrupted supply of the appropriate quantity of power (emphasis on ‚Äò</span><b>appropriate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äô) and stable, unrestricted access to the internet are the major resources needed to start mining. Good news, 5G will definitely soon go viral and make its way into developing nations (If you happen to live in one).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you acquire your hardware (as your budget may permit you), you have to <a class="extlink" href="https://hiveos.farm/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">begin the installation of Hive OS</a> on your miner. The Hive OS installer is available for both Windows, Mac and Linux, however, Hive OS itself is a linux-based operating system. It is a modified version of the Ubutu Linux distro. So your mining rig would always need to be booted into HiveOS to use it.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A piece of warning; the learning curve is steep ‚Äî You&#8217;ll have to become accustomed to words like GPU, ASIC, PXE, Hive OS Deploy, Block, Block Reward, Cloud Mining, <strong>Hash Rate, </strong>Mining Pool, Confirmations etc.¬†¬†</span></p>
<p>To start mining Hive OS, here are some non-negotiable requirements/expenses;</p>
<h2>Mining Rig</h2>
<p>A mining rig is <b>a computer system used for mining cryptocurrencies</b>. A mining rig might be a specialised computer that does no other work than to mine crypto (e.g the ASICs) or it could otherwise be a computer that fills other needs, such as performing as a gaming system, and is used to mine only on a part-time basis (e.g everyday, ¬†before you retire to bed.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are essentially three kinds of hardware you can use for mining cryptocurrency; </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit Miners)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">GPU (Graphics Processing Units)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPU (Central Processing Units)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HiveOS is only compatible with ASIC and GPU miners, which means investing on a higher end CPU would not result in an increased turnover on Hive OS. ¬†</span></p>

<h2>Broadband Internet</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I‚Äôll start with a list of countries and their average cost of data, to help you put this in perspective. I had to get help from a 2019 study carried out by </span><a class="extlink" href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17247/the-average-cost-of-mobile-data-in-selected-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statista.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><b>The Cost of Mobile Internet Around The World (in U.S. dollars)</b></p>

<h2>Electric Power</h2>
<p>Mining cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum is a GPU-intensive activity. After electric power, the GPUs, also called¬†Graphics Processing Unit are the most important component of your mining setup. The more powerful your GPU is, the higher its hash rate (measured in h/s) would be. The higher your hash rate is, the lesser the time required to complete a &#8220;proof of work&#8221;. To be rewarded, you need a proof of work.</p>
<p>Your hash rate can be drastically increased by using multiple GPUs in a rig. Unfortunately GPUs are power-hungry devices. A single GPU can consume up to 300W. They also produce a lot of heat in the process. Your PSU (or Power Supply Unit) is also an important factor to consider. Its capacity has to be enough for the energy requirements of the GPUs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright, now that you are able to envision the relationship between GPUs, PSUs, and Electricity Usage, let‚Äôs examine the cost of electric power in the following countries. </span></p>
<p><b>Electricity prices in U.S. dollars per kilowatt hour</b></p>
<figure id="attachment_1024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1024" style="width: 1618px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1024" title="Screenshot 2021 09 12 at 8.40.04 PM" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-12-at-8.40.04-PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2021 09 12 at 8.40.04 PM" width="1618" height="1186" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-12-at-8.40.04-PM.png 1618w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-12-at-8.40.04-PM-300x220.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-12-at-8.40.04-PM-1024x751.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-12-at-8.40.04-PM-768x563.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-12-at-8.40.04-PM-1536x1126.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1618px) 100vw, 1618px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1024" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Statista, 2021. (If your country is not listed, please, click <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/263492/electricity-prices-in-selected-countries/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> to see full report)</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="http://whattomine.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whattomine.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a tool that helps with calculating your profitability. This is very helpful if you wish to have an idea of how long it&#8217;ll take for you to break even with your current setup.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then HiveOS offers something worth considering; MSKMINER¬†is one of the largest and most experienced developers of firmware for Antminers. They offer an entire lineup on Antminer firmware, and provide very fast support for ASIC owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hive OS¬†on the other hand, is the most popular system for managing and monitoring workers. With it, you can actually be assured of stability, 24/7 support service system, and a seamless management of even the largest farms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an Avengers-like combo, MSKMINER and HiveOS decided to collaborate. This gave birth to what we now call the¬†<a class="extlink" href="https://hiveos.farm/asic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hiveon ASIC firmware powered by MSKMINER.</a></span></p>
<p>With this supercharged firmware, you&#8217;d get up to 80.1 Terahashes per second. That&#8217;s crazy!</p>
<figure id="attachment_1071" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1071" style="width: 2334px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1071" title="HiveOS and MSKMINER" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM.png" alt="HiveOS and MSKMINER" width="2334" height="696" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM.png 2334w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM-300x89.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM-1024x305.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM-768x229.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM-1536x458.png 1536w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM-2048x611.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2334px) 100vw, 2334px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1071" class="wp-caption-text">HiveOS and MSKMINER</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S17+ model is reported to deliver up¬†to 95Th/s with a Standard PSU. It provides its users with incredibly higher hashrate of up to 95Th/s, reliable security, and numerous monitoring features for free (Hive OS is free of charge for Hiveon ASIC firmware users). With this increased hashrate, you could mine more cryptocurrencies, in less time.¬†</span></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, back to the original question we‚Äôre trying to answer; <strong>is HiveOS worth it?¬†</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the following;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your choice of hardware; ASIC or GPU-based miners?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your location; which invariably determines the availability and cost of uninterrupted power supply and broadband internet. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your $3 monthly fee for each of your workers (Hive OS requires that you pay a monthly fee of $3 if you are using more than 4 workers.)<br />
<strong>üí°TIP: A worker</strong>¬†is a term used to describe any type of mining hardware that is supported by Hive OS: a rig ‚Äî a computer built with GPUs; and ASIC.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>With all the factors highlighted above, I will leave you to decide.</p>

<p>In this article, I will show you how to generate very beautiful static websites using WordPress and how you can host and plug them to a custom domain (www.yourbusiness.com) for free on Github Pages.</p>
<p>I am about to share a secret that I have used to save my clients a lot of money, keep their website blazing fast, secure, and maintenance-free.</p>



<p>The secret: I build their websites on localhost using WordPress, then I generate a static HTML version of the website and host it on GitHub Pages. To ensure the website loads over HTTPS, I use the SSL provided with the Cloudflare Free Plan.</p>





<p>With WordPress, you have <a class="extlink" href="https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hundreds of thousands of free and premium themes</a> and <a class="extlink" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">plugins</a> to choose from. You can also build your own custom templates using Elementor Pro.</p>
<pre><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>TIP:</strong></span>  If you want to see a full list of the <a href="https://branditechture.com/when-to-choose-a-static-website-over-a-dynamic-website-and-why-you-should/">advantages of using static websites</a>, quickly glance through <a href="https://branditechture.com/when-to-choose-a-static-website-over-a-dynamic-website-and-why-you-should/">this post</a> and come back here.</pre>

<h2>2. Create Github Repository</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to create a repository (or repo) from which your website would be served.</p>



<p>To do this, you first have to <strong><a class="extlink" href="https://github.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">create a Github account</a></strong> if you don&#8217;t have one.</p>



<p>After logging in, create a repo with name of your website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="704" height="350" class="wp-image-564" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.42.21-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 09 02 at 12.42.21 PM" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.42.21-PM.png 704w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.42.21-PM-300x149.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /></figure>



<p>Click on the <strong>New</strong> button coloured green.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1014" height="1024" class="wp-image-565" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.44.32-PM-1014x1024.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 09 02 at 12.44.32 PM" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.44.32-PM-1014x1024.png 1014w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.44.32-PM-297x300.png 297w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.44.32-PM-150x150.png 150w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.44.32-PM-768x775.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.44.32-PM.png 1254w" sizes="(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px" /></figure>



<p>Put the name of your website In the text field under <strong>Repository name *</strong>.</p>



<p>As explained earlier, a repo acts like a folder that will hold the website&#8217;s source files. I named mine <strong>&#8220;my staticwebsite&#8221;</strong> but you can give yours any name.</p>



<h2 id="h-3-install-github-desktop">3. Install Github Desktop</h2>



<p>I am a busy <a class="extlink" href="https://dribbble.com/designeryusuf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Graphic Designer</a> with a phobia for command line errors so I avoid Git CLI. I prefer to use Github Desktop instead.</p>



<p>If you are someone who doesn&#8217;t like Command Line Interface like me, <a class="extlink" href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Github Desktop</a> is a very good alternative to Git CLI.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="540" class="wp-image-566" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-1.36.37-PM-min-1024x540.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 09 02 at 1.36.37 PM min" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-1.36.37-PM-min-1024x540.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-1.36.37-PM-min-300x158.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-1.36.37-PM-min-768x405.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-1.36.37-PM-min-1536x809.png 1536w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-1.36.37-PM-min-2048x1079.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>To Install Github Desktop, Go to <a class="extlink" href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desktop.github.com</a>. Click on the big purple <strong>Download for [Your OS]</strong> button to <strong>download</strong> the installer, then install it on your machine.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-create-an-offline-clone-of-your-repo">4. Create An Offline Clone of Your Repo</h2>



<p>Luckily, Github Desktop allows us to <strong>clone</strong> repositories to our local drives, so we will use it to clone the repo we just created.</p>



<p>It will also <strong>track and sync changes</strong> to files in the repo;<strong> both on Github.com and your local offline copy</strong> (which is basically a folder).</p>



<p>To clone the repo we created on Github.com;</p>



<p>Launch Github Desktop</p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£¬†Sign in with the same Github account which you used to <strong>create the repo</strong> in <strong>step 2 </strong>(above). To sign in, click <strong>Github </strong>&gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Sign In</strong> under <strong>Github.com</strong> (Not Enterprise). But if you use Windows, then that would be <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Options </strong>&gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Sign In</strong></p>
<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ After successful authentication, it&#8217;s time to clone the repo we had created earlier on to our local storage. To do that, go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Clone Repository</strong>. You will notice an option to choose a <strong>local path</strong> to clone to. Create a Folder named <strong>Github</strong> in your <strong>Documents</strong> folder. and choose to clone your repo into it. Your local path should look something like;¬†<strong>/Users/apple/Documents/Github</strong></p>
<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ After setting your local path, choose the repo you created in <strong>Step 2</strong> and click on the <strong>Clone</strong> button on the lower right corner of the modal.</p>
<p>If everything goes well, you should have a local version of your repo in <strong>Documents &gt; Github</strong> (depending on the local path set above)</p>

<h2 id="h-5-install-mamp">5. Install MAMP</h2>



<p>MAMP is a local web development solution that allows us to develop PHP-powered websites on a local machine without having to purchase a <a class="extlink" href="https://support.branditechture.agency/docs/what-is-website-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web hosting</a> plan.</p>



<p>WordPress is powered by PHP, hence to create a WordPress website with our local machine, we would need a local server such as the one MAMP offers.</p>



<p>To download and install MAMP, go to <a class="extlink" href="https://mamp.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mamp.info</a> and click on the ‚¨áÔ∏è<strong> Free Download</strong> button. Wait for download to complete and install on your computer as usual.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="467" class="wp-image-572" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-6.53.07-AM-min-1024x467.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 09 03 at 6.53.07 AM min" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-6.53.07-AM-min-1024x467.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-6.53.07-AM-min-300x137.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-6.53.07-AM-min-768x350.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-6.53.07-AM-min-1536x701.png 1536w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-6.53.07-AM-min-2048x934.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now that you have installed MAMP. It is time to Install WordPress on your local machine. Which takes us to the next step.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-install-wordpress">6. Install WordPress</h2>



<p>Installing WordPress is a little bit tricky for beginners because the process is not the same on Windows and Mac. This is due to the varying directory structure on both OS, and maybe the subtle differences between the MAMP UI on both platforms.</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to <a class="extlink" href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wordpress.org/download</a> and scroll down until you see the Download Wordpress button.</li>
<li>Download the WordPress .zip archive by clicking on the button.</li>
</ol>



<p>Follow the guide below for a step by step installation of WordPress for your OS;</p>

</ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>TIP:</strong> You can also use any existing WordPress installation; whether on localhost or on a live server.</pre>



<h2 id="h-7-generate-static-html-files-from-wordpress">7. Generate Static HTML Files From WordPress</h2>



<p>There are a few other plugins that can do this, but I found the <strong>Simply Static</strong> plugin to be very straightforward.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-577 size-full" title="Screen Shot 2021 09 03 at 2.09.16 PM" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-2.09.16-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 09 03 at 2.09.16 PM" width="1914" height="870" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-2.09.16-PM.png 1914w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-2.09.16-PM-300x136.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-2.09.16-PM-1024x465.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-2.09.16-PM-768x349.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-2.09.16-PM-1536x698.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1914px) 100vw, 1914px" /></p>



<p>From your WordPress Admin</p>



<p>Go to <strong>Plugins</strong> &gt;&gt;<strong> Add new</strong></p>



<p>Search for ‚Äú<a class="extlink" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simply Static</a>‚Äù. <strong>Install</strong> and <strong>activate</strong> it.</p>
<p>Copy the directory path of your repo and paste it as shown in the screenshot below;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-586 size-full" title="Simply Static Settings" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simply-Static-Settings.png" alt="Simply Static Settings" width="1548" height="1390" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simply-Static-Settings.png 1548w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simply-Static-Settings-300x269.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simply-Static-Settings-1024x919.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simply-Static-Settings-768x690.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simply-Static-Settings-1536x1379.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1548px) 100vw, 1548px" /></p>
<p>Click¬†<strong>Save Changes.¬†</strong></p>
<p>Now, <strong>Simply Static</strong> &gt; <strong>Generate¬†</strong>then click¬†<strong>Generate Static Files</strong></p>
<pre>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: If you have been following this tutorial using a web host or a live server, your server may not be able to write directly to your local repo and you would get the error; <strong>unable to create destination directory</strong>. In this case, you must use the ¬†<strong>ZIP Archive¬†</strong>Delivery Method ( <strong>Simply Static</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Delivery Method</strong> &gt; <strong>ZIP Archive</strong>) and manually extract the generated static html and other assets into your local repo folder. <br /><br />If you are using MAMP, ignore this message and continue reading below.</pre>
<p>If all goes well, your static WordPress site will be exported as static HTML pages in the repo folder path.</p>

<pre>‚ö†Ô∏è The button says <strong>"Publish Branch"</strong> because we want to publish to an <strong>empty</strong> <strong>Github.com </strong>repo.¬†<br /><br />Next time we regenerate our static WordPress file, and want to <strong>Push the changes to Github.com,</strong> the button won't display <strong>Publish Branch</strong>, but¬†<strong>Push Origin.</strong><br /><br />Don't get confused, they both do the same job of pushing your changes to Github.¬†</pre>
<p>Now, it is time to covert our repo from just an ordinary repo to <strong>Github Pages.</strong> To do this, go to <a class="extlink" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/</a>, make sure you are logged in with your account as usual.</p>
<p>Click on the repo we have been working on, then click on <strong>Settings &gt; Pages.¬†</strong>Set your Github Pages branch to <strong>Main </strong>as shown in the screenshot below;¬†</p>

<h1>8. Connect GitHub Pages to Your Namecheap Domain</h1>
<h3>Github Setup</h3>
<p>This part explains how to connect your Namecheap domain to a GitHub Pages repository in GitHub.</p>
<p>Be sure you are on the <strong>Pages</strong> settings of your repository. (<strong>Choose</strong>¬†<strong>Repo </strong>&gt;¬†<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Pages</strong>)</p>
<p>In the <strong>Custom Domain</strong> box, enter the domain you registered with Namecheap, and click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<pre><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Note:</strong></span> You may notice a new file called CNAME when you return to your repository's <strong>Code</strong> tab. This is completely normal, and it occurs after setting a custom domain. The CNAME is a very important file for your custom domain to work with Github.¬†This file will include just one line of code; which is the domain you added in the Custom Domain Box.</pre>
<h3>Namecheap Setup</h3>
<p>Login to your Namecheap account.</p>
<p>Navigate to the <strong>Domain List</strong> and click on <strong>Manage</strong> to the far right of your domain name.</p>
<p>From there, click on the <strong>Advanced DNS</strong> tab. Click <strong>Add New Record</strong> to add each of the following five records:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Websites can be built using a variety of languages; programming, markup, and markdown languages. They come in different sizes and shapes, but no matter what, a website is either <strong>static</strong> or <strong>dynamic</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>What is a Static Website?</strong></p>



<p>A static website is the most basic form of website. It is rendered on the browser exactly as stored, and nothing changes on a per-user basis. This means that the same content is served for every user.</p>



<p><strong>What is a Dynamic Website?</strong></p>



<p>A dynamic website is the type of website that renders the webpage <strong>at the time of request</strong>. Dynamic websites are usually built using one or more programming languages and they feature a database. They support features like user authentication, personalisation, per-user preferences, e-commerce, cookies etc.</p>



<p><strong>Facebook.com</strong> is an example of a dynamic website. The name on my profile, my friends list, my newsfeed etc, will always differ from yours. These variables are generated from a database and rendered at the time of requesting each page.</p>




<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>Need to build a website that truly works? Branditechture Design Agency offers <a class="extlink" href="https://branditechture.agency/lets-build-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bespoke¬†website solutions</a>¬†that you can truly call your own.</strong>

<strong>Click <a class="extlink" href="https://branditechture.agency/lets-build-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HERE</a> to get started ASAP.</strong><strong>¬†</strong></pre>



<h2 id="h-advantages-of-static-websites">Advantages of Static Websites</h2>



<p>You may be tempted to ask, &#8220;with all the awesome features of dynamic websites, why would someone opt for a static website?&#8221;¬†</p>



<p>Well, here are some genuine reasons to choose a static website over a dynamic website;</p>



<ul>
<li>Static websites do not require a database to render pages.</li>
<li>SEO Benefits; Search Engine Crawlers don&#8217;t have a hard time crawling Static HTML websites.</li>
<li>They are not resource-intensive, meaning that they&#8217;ll still respond relatively well on high concurrent usage (i.e The number of multiple website users at any given time).</li>
<li>Static websites are unbelievably fast since no real time server preprocessing is required.</li>
<li>They are secure and maintenance-free, which means static websites are rid of any security vulnerability even if left unmaintained for several years.</li>
<li>The codebase of any static website can be easily read by any human with basic understanding of HTML, CSS &amp; JS, leading to easier bug fixes.</li>
<li>Migrating static websites from one server to another server is relatively easy. It only involves copying the files from one server location to another. No additional steps such as database reconnection would be required.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some of the advantages listed above are hard to ignore, so whenever I am contracted to build a website, I first consider whether or not a static site would be enough to meet my client‚Äôs needs, and most of the times, it is.¬†</p>



<h2>Types of websites that can be made static.</h2>



<p>Just in case you are wondering what types of websites can be made static, here are some use cases;</p>



<h3 id="h-1-blog">1. Blog</h3>



<p>This is hard to believe, but static websites can also be used for fully-featured blogs.¬†</p>

<p>This blog post you are currently reading is an example of a static blog. This page is originally an HTML file that was rendered as-is. As a matter of fact, no server-side preprocessing was needed. This was made possible by a WordPress plugin called Simply Static &#8211; A WordPress-powered static website generator.</p>



<p>Are you still in doubt? You can verify by copying and pasting this link in your browser; <br />üëâüèæ <strong>https://branditechture.com/index.html</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">If you are interested in building your own static blog/website using WordPress, then <strong><a href="https://branditechture.com/free-static-website-hosting-with-namecheap-wordpress-github-pages-and-cloudflare/">read this post.</a> </strong> </pre>



<p><a href="https://branditechture.com/">This blog</a> has Yoast SEO tools, Google Analytics, Dedicated Author Pages, Navigational Menus, and pretty much anything that can be found on any WordPress blog. All thanks to Simply Static, a WordPress Static Site Generator.</p>



<p>Blogs are nothing but content rendered via templates. You don‚Äôt need a heavy-weight application to parse every request before rendering a new page.</p>



<p>If you want a fast-loading blog and a customised design in record time, a <a href="https://branditechture.com/free-static-website-hosting-with-namecheap-wordpress-github-pages-and-cloudflare/">static site generated from WordPress</a> is the perfect option for you.¬†</p>



<h3 id="h-2-one-page-website">2.¬†One-page Website</h3>



<p>As opposed to a multi-page website, a single-page website is a website having only one HTML page, which is usually the index-page.</p>



<p>Despite having just a single page, One-page websites can still have navigation menu items that scroll up or down to the target section when clicked on. For easier navigation, the nav bar can be made sticky.¬†</p>



<h3 id="h-3-landing-pages">3. Landing Pages</h3>



<p>If you just launched a new app, but you need a platform to spread the word and feature links to both the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android) versions of the app, you&#8217;ll need is a Landing page.</p>



<p>Landing pages are used to provide information on (and ultimately sell) a certain product or concept. A landing page is similar to a One-page website, but there is no rule restricting it to only one page ‚Äì It can have dedicated pages for¬†<strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</strong>¬†and¬†<strong>About Us.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, the widespread adoption of the POS business model in Nigeria has significantly contributed to <a class="extlink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/african-fintech-opay-valued-at-2b-in-softbank-vision-fund-2-led-400m-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Opay&#8217;s 2bn US Dollar milestone</a> (~ 1 trillion Naira), comfortably superseding Flutterwave&#8217;s $1bn+ valuation to make it the most valuable unicorn startup in Nigeria.</p>



<p>As we all know, a single stream of income is no longer considered sustainable in today&#8217;s economy. The economy has suffered a series of inflation up to this point, but you know what? The tough and smart ones would still continue to thrive financially.</p>



<p>In a bid to live a quality life devoid of compulsive borrowing from <a href="https://branditechture.com/nigerians-continue-to-lament-incessant-defamation-from-loan-apps/">loan sharks</a>, a lot of enterprenuers, salary earners, government workers, etc have resorted to one or more side hustle, with POS business being one of the top options on the list.</p>



<p>In today&#8217;s article, we would be sharing some useful tips on how to maximize your POS shop by adding some more business to your existing<strong> POS business. </strong></p>



<p>Sincerely speaking, anytime I come accross people operating POS as their only business. I just murmur to myself &#8220;what a waste!&#8221;.</p>



<p>There are several other business ventures you can add to¬†your POS Business¬†but let&#8217;s talk about at 8 of them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" class="wp-image-460" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/POS1.jpg" alt="POS1" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/POS1.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/POS1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/POS1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 id="h-here-are-8-other-businesses-you-can-add-to-your-pos-business">Here are 8 other businesses you can add to your POS Business</h2>



<ol>
<li>Face masks &amp; handkerchief</li>
<li>Recharge card business</li>
<li>Bottled water, Pure Water, soft drinks</li>
<li>Zobo, Kunu &amp; Other Home made Beverages</li>
<li>Snacks &amp; Confectioneries</li>
<li>Peppered Ponmo &amp; fried meat Business</li>
<li>Printing and photocopying business</li>
<li>Stationery</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-1-face-masks-handkerchief">1. Face masks &amp; handkerchief</h2>



<p>If you wore face masks on the streets 3 years ago, people would think you are nuts. However, the COVID-19 has paved the way for a multi-billion naira face mask industry, after its discovery in a city called Wuhan in China in December 2019. The face mask and hand sanitizer have therefore become a popular household item.</p>



<p>The disposable nature of face masks have made them a recurring expense, which puts you in a favourable position as a seller.</p>



<p>Although Nigeria and other African countries aren&#8217;t as hit as their European and American counterparts, a face mask still remains an important requirement for entering any commercial, residential or governmental building today, hence making it an on-demand commodity.</p>



<p>Have you ever wondered why some able-bodied guys would rather prefer to hawk handkerchiefs and face masks in traffic? The reason is not far-fetched; it&#8217;s the profits associated with it.</p>



<p>Why would someone choose not to leverage such a fantastic opportunity to support the income from their POS business?</p>



<p>Handkerchief is another multipurpose commodity that has enjoyed an all-time fame. Unlike the face mask, it has been a popular commodity since God knows when üòÅ, which is an indication that it is going nowhere soon.</p>



<p><strong>TIP:</strong> The face mask business is especially great if your shop is located at a close proximity to a commercial building such as an office or supermarket. I can assure you that you&#8217;ll often run out of stock if you don&#8217;t have a reliable supply chain.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-2-recharge-card-business">2. Recharge Card Business</h2>



<p>Recharge card business¬†will certainly not make you rich over night but will be enough to offset some bills.</p>



<p>People still recharge their phones every day due to the need to make calls and send messages, so you&#8217;ll surely have a market waiting for you if your shop is situated in a busy spot with constant traffic. However, it is worth mentioning that the purchase of printed recharge pins is now on the decline due to the increasing popularity of USSD and mobile app top-up channels.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nothwithstanding, you can still make between ‚Ç¶400 &#8211; ‚Ç¶600 in profit for each ‚Ç¶10,000 worth of recharge card sold.</p>



<p>While POS machines can print recharge PINs, I would advise that you should only use it to print higher denominations. Printing too many lower denominations (i.e., anything below ‚Ç¶500) may not compensate for the paper used.</p>



<h2 id="h-3-bottled-water-pure-water-soft-drink-business">3. Bottled Water / Pure Water / Soft Drink business</h2>



<p>Some people arrive at your shop really tasty and wouldn&#8217;t mind buying some water to quench their thirst.</p>



<p>Pure water business is very lucrative; You can get at least 100% ROI from as little as a bag of pure water.</p>



<p>A bag of pure water costs between ‚Ç¶80 &#8211; ‚Ç¶90 per bag, and each bag contains 20pcs of 50cl satchets. Now let&#8217;s do the maths;</p>

<p>1 Bag of <em>Pure Water</em> is sold for N90, and it contains 20pcs of 50cl satchets.</p>



<p><strong>You sell</strong> each 50cl satchet of water for ‚Ç¶10</p>



<p><strong>You sold</strong> 20 sachets of water = ‚Ç¶200</p>



<p><strong>Your Profit:</strong> ‚Ç¶110</p>



<p><strong>Your ROI:</strong> 122%</p>



<p>The best part of this business is that the distributors deliver your <em>Pure Water</em> stocks right in front of your shop/doorstep, effectively saving you the costs of logistics if you were be moving it from their factory to your shop yourself.</p>



<p>With the rate at which soft drinks are being consumed in Nigeria, you could easily increase your net revenue by considering bringing soft drinks into the equation.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-zobo-kunu-and-other-home-made-drinks">4. Zobo, Kunu and other home made drinks</h2>



<p>Zobo, kunu, tigernut drink, lolly, condensed milk, are common home made drinks that you can also venture into. There is a very high profit margin involved in doing this business if you can successfully pull it off.</p>



<p>A ‚Ç¶250 worth of dried hibiscus leaves (used for making Zobo) can bring returns as high as ‚Ç¶1,200, but considering the costs of other ingredients such as sugar and ginger, you can still make up to ‚Ç¶1000 in pure profits for every ‚Ç¶250 invested. That is a lot of money.</p>



<p>We also have others like kunu aya (tigernut), kunun zaki, fura da nunu, lolly, condensed milk (locally known as condense), lolly e.t.c, which are all beverages that can be made at home and sold in your shop.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">üí° <strong>TIP:</strong> If you need to add some branding and professional packaging to your home made drinks to make them more appealing to the upper-class, click <a class="extlink" href="https://branditechture.agency/start-a-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HERE</a> and select <strong>Product Packaging Design</strong>.</pre>



<h2>5. Snacks &amp; Confectioneries</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="830" height="1024" class="wp-image-472" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Puff-Puff-830x1024.jpeg" alt="Puff Puff" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Puff-Puff-830x1024.jpeg 830w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Puff-Puff-243x300.jpeg 243w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Puff-Puff-768x948.jpeg 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Puff-Puff.jpeg 875w" sizes="(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px" />
<figcaption>Puff Puff</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>If you have some baking skills, you can either purchase a small transparent food storage box, or a bigger show glass to showcase your snacks to passers-by ‚Äî It all depends on your prefered scale and starting capital (or budget).</p>



<p>You can make snacks like puff-puff, chin chin, minced pie, eggroll, sausages, sandwiches, buns, doughnuts e.t.c. at home and sell in your shop.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>TIP:</strong> If you can't have afford the time to prepare snacks, you can make an arrangement with a skilled professional to be supplying you snacks on a daily basis.</pre>



<p>Unfortunately, not everyone has the ability or skill to make some tasty bakes. If you belong in this group, you can either outsource it to someone else as mentioned above, or just sell ready-to-eat snacks like Sausage rolls, biscuits, cheese balls, e.t.c. Popular choices are Gala, Munch It, Nkatie Burger. These snacks are very popular among school children and even busy office workers.</p>



<p>Popcorn production is also something that might interest you. Good pop corn machines can be found and purchsed on online marketplaces like Jiji.ng and Jumia.</p>

<p>Perhaps, I should have added this as an item in the Snacks category above, but I think it deserves its own space.</p>



<p>I promise you, peppered Ponmo (popularly called <strong><em>Ponmo alata</em></strong> in Yoruba) alone is a legend on the streets on Lagos.</p>



<p>If not because of Ponmo, I would have built a house in Ikoyi!!! I can spend my last card on ponmo and fried meat, and there are thousands of other people like me as well. The best part? You don&#8217;t need a huge storage space.</p>



<p>Ponmo and fried meat can last for up to a week under normal storage conditions.</p>



<p><strong><em>Ponmo to muta</em></strong> üôåüèΩ</p>



<h2 id="h-7-photocopying-business">7. Photocopying Business</h2>



<p>Who says you need a computer to start a photocopying business? Not at all!</p>



<p>If you are in a business or school district, you can quickly grab a fairly-used <strong>Konica Minolta</strong> Photocopier on Jiji and start your photocopying business ASAP.</p>



<p>Konica Minolta printers are the perfect cost-effective choice for small and growing businesses because they make it easy to do more while spending less. Konica Minolta&#8217;s Bizhub Multi-Function Printers (bizhub MFP) offer fast printing, high-quality copying, scanning to PDF, color laser printing, and the latest tech features for network and cloud printing.</p>



<p>However, do ensure that you only purchase from a reputable dealer that also offers aftersale maintenance services.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll also need to take into consideration the costs of buying papers (usually A4) and printer inks.</p>



<h2 id="h-8-stationery">8. Stationery</h2>



<p>Exercise books, pencil and pens, markers, sharpeners e.t.c are petty stationery items that won&#8217;t take an extra space in your shop. If you are in a close proximity to an educational facility, such as a school, then it would be worth giving a try.</p>



<p>Let me have your opinion on this discussion in the comment section below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The concept of being able to access collateral-free loans by just downloading an app seems incredible to many Nigerians ‚Äî This reality has effectively made loan apps the most notable invention of the fastest-growing sector in the tech industry in Nigeria; Fintech.</p>



<p>Loan apps like<strong> Branch, Carbon, Quick Check and FairMoney </strong>have started seeing competition from the likes of <strong>Okash, Soko Loan, 9Credit </strong>etc, as loan apps continue to make their way into the lives of more Nigerians. </p>



<p>As a matter of fact, we have no less than 25 Nigerian loan apps on the Google Play Store.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While this is supposed to be a blessing to the average Nigerian citizen, a considerable majority of these tech firms have further plunged Nigerians into agony&nbsp;‚Äî not only financially, but through the <strong>defamation of character.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a financial implication, some salary earners literally<strong><em> work for </em></strong>these loan sharks, no thanks to their super-high interest rate and short-term repayment time. The maximum loan term is usually between 7-30 days, with interest rates as high as 50%! &nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-loan-apps-are-guilty-of-this">What loan apps are guilty of this?</h2>



<p>Based on reviews from users, firsthand experience, and feedbacks on various internet forums, the following apps have been confirmed to derive pleasure in disgracing defaulting customers and even picking up fights before the end of their loan duration;</p>



<ol><li>Sokoloan</li><li>9Credit</li><li>NairaPlus</li><li>Go Cash</li><li>9jaCash</li><li>LionCash</li><li>GMoney </li><li>GetCash</li><li>FastMoney</li><li>ICoin </li></ol>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-if-you-default-on-a-loan">What happens if you default on a loan?</h2>



<p>If you default on a loan, your total amount due would start to increase by 1 &#8211; 2% per day after the due date. </p>



<p>In spite of their humongous interest rates and late fees, these lending platforms take extreme measures in their process of debt recovery, causing harrassment, humiliation and irreparable defamation of character to loan defaulters ‚Äî Whether your reasons for defaulting are of genuine concern or not, they will send libellous text messages to your contacts; brand you a wanted criminal who ran away with their company‚Äôs money. </p>



<p>I consider this measure extreme because long lost friends, family members, bosses, colleagues at work, religious colleagues, and siblings all of whose contacts you have saved to your phone, would be bombarded with demeaning messages about your personality.</p>



<p>In some cases, one is likely to be threatened personally about having their details sent to the Credit Bureau for blacklisting if they fail to make repayment on time. And even before the due date, there are constant phone calls and text messages that can be considered intrusive ‚Äî all to remind borrowers to make payment before the due date.</p>



<p>Some borrowers have been pushed to the brink of suicide for being humiliated in such irrepairable ways.</p>



<p>For Example, here are screenshots of the messages I got after one of my contacts borrowed money from an app called 9Credit and has failed to pay back after about three weeks passed since the due date.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Other Real Life Experiences As Narrated By Nigerians</h2>



<p>According to a Nairaland user with the username <strong><em>Mrporanir</em>: </strong>&#8220;I blame the Android OS for not regulating them on Play Store, you can never find such apps on the Apple iOS Store. I also blame the CBN for not regulating these loan sharks.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="h-nitda-s-intervention">NITDA&#8217;s Intervention</h2>



<p>Last week, a loan app called Sokoloan was fined 10 Million Naira by the Nigerian Information Technology Development Agency (or NITDA) for their persistent violation of privacy and misuse of users data. According to NITDA‚Äôs spokesperson, Hadiza Umar, ‚Äã‚ÄãNITDA had sanctioned Soko Lending Company Limited for invasion of privacy.</p>



<p>This action was taken after receiving a series of complaints by Nigerians against the lending company for unauthorised disclosures, failure to protect customers‚Äô personal data and defamation of character as well as carrying out the necessary due diligence as mandated in the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) which was published in 2019 by NITDA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An excerpt of the statement reads as follows; ‚ÄúOne of such complaints filed by <strong><em>Bloomgate Solicitors</em></strong> on behalf of its client, the data subject, was received on Monday, 11th November 2019. NITDA, as part of its due diligence process, commenced investigation over the alleged infractions of the provisions of the NDPR.‚Äù</p>



<p>‚ÄúAccording to one of the complainants, when he failed to meet up with his repayment obligations due to insufficient credit in his account on the date the direct debit was to take effect, the company unilaterally sent privacy-invading messages to the complainant‚Äôs contacts.</p>



<p>‚ÄúInvestigation revealed that the complainant&#8217;s contacts who were neither parties to the loan transaction nor consented to the processing of their data have confirmed the receipt of such messages.‚Äù</p>



<p>It continues, ‚ÄúThe agency made strident efforts to get Soko Loan to change the unethical practice but to no avail. After the agency‚Äôs investigation team secured a lien order on one of the company‚Äôs accounts by which it could come up with privacy-enhancing solutions for its business model, Soko Loan decided to rebrand and direct its customers to pay into its other business accounts.‚Äù</p>



<p>‚ÄúThe agency‚Äôs investigation further revealed that the company embeds trackers that share data with third parties inside its mobile application without providing users information about it or using the appropriate lawful basis.‚Äù</p>



<p>For the alleged breaches of privacy, NITDA thereby imposed a monetary sanction of 10 million Naira on Soko Loan.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>While your reasons for wanting a loan might be genuine, I would strongly recommend asking from your friends, family, colleagues or even your clients. By so doing, you&#8217;d not only avoid incurring huge interests on these loan apps, but you&#8217;d also have control over your personal data, thereby avoiding a full-blown defamation of your character by these loan sharks who charge as high as 30% &#8211; 50% for short-term loans.</p>



<p>Try to build a saving culture using an app like <strong><a class="extlink" href="https://www.piggyvest.com/?newref=1&amp;ref=4c48c54ec10419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Piggyvest</a></strong> rather than spend everything that comes your way. This way, you can have some funds to fall back on in cases of emergencies rather than settle for loan sharks, default and face constant humiliation, harassment and threats.</p>



<p>I hope the CBN has plans to eliminate all the insanity currently going on in the fintech sector but till then, let&#8217;s thread safely.</p>



<p>Thank you for reading to this very end. Your comments are welcome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is a growing concern about the level of professionalism in the field of website design and it is becoming quite annoying. In the past, website design used to be an honourable profession and only a few could qualify as a web designer or developer. This is perhaps due to the barriers which were previously associated with accessing web design tools, training, and certifications, but sadly, the industry is now oversaturated with quacks as any Monkey with a laptop and mobile internet access can easily pass for a website designer. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme-1024x768.jpg" alt="Angry Woman and Cat Meme" class="wp-image-232" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme-300x225.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme-768x576.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme.jpg 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>What is the motivation behind this post?</strong></p>



<p>The overwhelming increase in the number of quack web designers on the World Wide Web has now made it very difficult for prospective website owners to avoid playing into the wrong hands. At least, 1 in every 5 website owners fall prey to a quack web designer. That&#8217;s not all ‚Äî some prospective website owners have been tricked to part ways with their money in exchange for absolutely no value. To this end, I felt the need to do my own part by writing this piece.</p>



<p>I know it is impossible to eradicate this plague, but I want to believe that no one reads these tips and still ends up with a quack.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-request-their-portfolio-and-assess-their-own-website">1. Request their portfolio and assess their own website</h2>



<p>There is no gainsaying that this should be the first thing you should request from any web designer you are looking to hire. However, despite the fact that many people request a portfolio, they still fall prey to quack web designers because they forgot to request their own website. </p>



<p>The most important item on a web designer&#8217;s portfolio is arguably their own website. This is because a quack website designer can easily claim he built any website by just sending you a bunch of web links, but you&#8217;d be more accurate if you judge their capabilities by taking a look at their very own website.  </p>



<p>Take note of the following red flags;</p>



<ul><li>They don&#8217;t have a website.</li><li>They claim their website is under construction.</li><li>Their website loads very slowly.</li><li>Their website lacks content.</li><li>You see some dummy <strong><em>&#8220;Lorem Ipsum&#8221;</em></strong> texts scattered all over the place.</li><li>Unforgivable grammatical errors, both on and off their website.  </li></ul>



<h2 id="h-2-access-yourself-and-prepare-ahead">2. Access yourself and prepare ahead</h2>



<p>As a prospective website owner, it is also important for you to do a personal self-assessment as you are very likely to end up with a quack web designer if one or more of the reasons below apply to you;</p>



<ul><li>You don&#8217;t have an eye for good design.</li><li>You fail to discuss the performance side of your project.</li><li>Your budget is too low.</li><li>You overlook some or all of the red flags.</li></ul>



<p>It is quite simple ‚Äî before embarking on a search for <a class="extlink" href="https://branditechture.agency/lets-build-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a good web designer,</a> you should at least have some realistic expectations of what you wish to derive from the website in view; both aesthetically and functionally. You can achieve this by browsing through websites that share the same goal as yours, then noting down the things you like about them. You might also want to engage a reputable design-savvy friend to help you with making design-related decisions. </p>



<p>Take note of crucial things like the website&#8217;s <strong>Loading Speed,</strong> <strong>Content Structure and Hierarchy, Font Choices, Font Sizes and Styles, Colours, Logo Placement, Images e.t.c,</strong> and ensure it strikes a consistency with your brand or business, then ask if the web designer can help you achieve the same thing (by submitting it as a written brief). However, don&#8217;t take their word for it because they&#8217;ll most likely return an affirmative answer. </p>



<p>Now, here is the tricky part; You must verify their claim by cross-checking it against their portfolio (which you must have requested earlier) and look out for that same pattern in their previous works. <strong>Do previous works reflect their claims?</strong> If the answer is a big no, <strong><em>run for your life!</em></strong> But if the answer seems inconclusive, Still, <strong><em>run for your life</em></strong> (or proceed at your own risk). </p>



<p>It has to be a strong <strong>YES</strong>, which means all the website design projects featured on their portfolio must reflect their claims.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Before you hire your next web designer, it is always a good idea to consider the two points above. They would go a long way in saving you from a potentially devastating disappointment. I have intentionally kept this article brief and straightforward so that it is very easy to follow, but if you have a tip that I have missed out, then share with us in the comments below. </p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">TLDR;</span></strong>
With a potential viewing and followership of over 12 million Africans daily and over 87% of that crowd being between 18 &amp; 35 years of age, the <strong>Big Brother Season 6; Shine Ya Eye</strong> is definitely a humongous publicity opportunity. An opportunity <strong><em>Abeg</em></strong> is leveraging well through its sponsorship deal with the platform. So well, the <strong><em>Abeg Naira</em></strong> is the official in-house currency of the housemates; that‚Äôs what they spend.</pre>



<p>It‚Äôs being scientifically proven that you remember names, better and more aptly than you do numbers.</p>



<p>Now, which fintech platform is utilizing this proven scientific fact for the good of their users?</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">Abeg!</span></strong></p>



<p>It‚Äôs the sixth season of the biggest reality TV show on the African continent right now, and there‚Äôs more mind-blowing gist than the usual in-house fights, love, and heartbreak and betrayal stories. And for the first time, the spotlight is shared by the sponsors (it‚Äôs usually all about the housemates only).</p>



<p>This sponsor is <strong><em>Abeg</em></strong>.</p>



<p>Wait, wait, wait, what?!</p>



<p>Okay, let me fill you in from the beginning.</p>



<p>In a land of myth and a time of‚Ä¶scratch that!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-1-abeg-naira-in-naira">What is 1 Abeg Naira in Naira?</h2>



<p>This is a question on the lips of many ‚Äî especially those who are just new to the show. Now, let&#8217;s settle it; The Abeg Naira is a currency that only has an intrinsic value in the Big Brother House. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-video aligncenter"><video controls src="https://github.com/branditechture/branditechture.github.io/raw/master/static-assets/IMG_5512.mp4"></video><figcaption>Big Brother Housemate, Cross counting his Abeg Nairas.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on the terms of the 2bn Naira sponsorship deal, the Abeg Naira is the only supported currency in the Big Brother House, and it was designed to be used to purchase items by the Big Brother Season 6 Housemates. </p>



<p>Nice brand awareness strategy, I&#8217;d say.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video aligncenter"><video controls src="https://github.com/branditechture/branditechture.github.io/raw/master/static-assets/IMG_5513.mp4"></video><figcaption>The Housemates doing some shopping with their Abeg Naira</figcaption></figure>



<p>Abeg Nairas cannot be exhanged with fiat currency, so there is no basis of comparison with the Nigerian Naira. Abeg Naira has to be earned by the housemates via rewards from sponsored tasks, thus effectively making some housemates richer than others.  </p>



<p>As for how much 1 Abeg Naira is valued against the Naira, you‚Äôd be asking the wrong question. </p>



<p>The phrase &#8220;Abeg Naira&#8221; may however see a subsequent use and popular adoption after the show is over, but that‚Äôd be something to definitely watch out for (who knows what cofounders Muheez Akanni and Dare Adekoya are up to?). </p>



<h2 id="h-what-inspired-the-abeg-app">What inspired the abeg app?</h2>



<p>Founded in 2019, Abeg Technologies is a team of vibrant youngsters led by the 26 year old <strong>Dare Adekoya;</strong> a talented product developer who designed the Abeg app as a response to a tweet by <strong><em>Asemota,</em></strong> sent to him by his friend <strong><em>Early Attoh</em></strong> on Dec 30, 2018, which read;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>‚ÄúI think one should build an app in Nigeria similar to $Cash and call it $Abeg. Bambiala culture is international.‚Äù</p><cite><strong>‚Äî Asemota</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>According to Dare, he just wanted to quickly flex his design skills and do something badass with the Abeg idea. The plan was to post it hoping it could trend. So, he started working on the mini task, but unplanned, he fell in love with the logo and the rest is as we see, is unfolding.</p>



<p>Abeg App offers an alternative to bank transactions, which are usually besieged by several network issues and very importantly, exterminates the need for account numbers or any other details that usually proves difficult to remember for most folks. Yes. The Abeg app uses usernames known as abegtags instead of account numbers. The only information required to sign up on the platform, is the phone number integrated with the user‚Äôs preregistered Bank Verification Number (BVN).</p>



<p>Making the younger demographics of the country its target market, the Abeg app has a user-friendly interface that the average Nigerian youth will relate to easily with the integration of the colloquial phrase used to beg for favors; <em><strong>‚ÄúAbeg‚Äù</strong></em>. </p>



<p>In the same vein, Abeg allows users to gift their friends‚Äô money, organize giveaways for their followers, conduct fundraisers and earn approval badges and score points for their display of generosity. The app also adopts an extensive use of emojis and sticker features to gain the interest of the younger demographic.</p>



<p>As amazing as this app seems, Abeg is not the first fintech in the Nigerian market ‚Äî There is already a domineering competition in the country and in the African tech market: <strong>Paga App</strong> with over 15.8M users as of June 2020, <strong>Cowrywise, </strong>handling over 220,000 users as of January 2021, <strong>Paystack</strong> serving over 60,000 users as of October 2020 and <strong>Kuda Bank,</strong> who just rounded up a successful series B serving over 1.4M users as of July 2021. However, Abeg App now has now implemented a marketing strategy that none of these fintech companies have used: <strong>Big Brother Season 6; Shine Ya Eye.</strong></p>



<h2>Headline Sponsorship </h2>



<p><strong>Abeg</strong>&nbsp;is the <strong><a class="extlink" href="https://africamagic.dstv.com/show/big-brother-naija/news/multichoice-unveils-abeg-as-s6-headline-sponsor-bbnaija/news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Headline Sponsor</a></strong> of Big Brother Naija Season 6 while the Associate Sponsor is&nbsp;<strong>PATRICIA.</strong></p>



<p>Rumor has it that <strong>PATRICIA</strong> paid about 1 Billion Naira whilst <strong>Abeg</strong> paid a whooping 2 Billion Naira (no, not Abeg Naira; actual Naira).</p>



<p>As such, a host of other brands including <em><strong>Payporte</strong></em>, <strong><em>Pepsi</em></strong> and <strong><em>Heritage Bank</em></strong> amongst others, dive into the sponsorship opportunities on Big Brother Season 6, to educate the public about their products/services. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="1024" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BB-Naija-Season-6-Sponsorship-Costs-Benefits-600x1024.png" alt="BB Naija Season 6 Sponsorship Costs Benefits" class="wp-image-193" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BB-Naija-Season-6-Sponsorship-Costs-Benefits-600x1024.png 600w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BB-Naija-Season-6-Sponsorship-Costs-Benefits-176x300.png 176w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BB-Naija-Season-6-Sponsorship-Costs-Benefits.png 683w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption>BB Naija Season 6 Sponsorship Costs Benefits</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Last year, Betway was rumored to have paid over 1Bn Naira in total sponsorship money for the 2020 edition tagged <strong>Big Brother Season 5; Lockdown</strong>.</p>



<p>But for a startup that‚Äôs less than 3 years old, the headline sponsorship for the Big Brother Naija season 6, <strong>Abeg</strong>, has left many to wonder about the brand‚Äôs revenue generation strategies, the product, and its co-founders.</p>
