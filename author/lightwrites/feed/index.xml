										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who wouldn’t fancy making $30- $150 per day, without having to negotiate or interact with anyone? Well, I think you do.</p>
<p>Yes, You!  <span style="font-weight: 400;">If that&#8217;s not what lead you to this article, then I can only wonder what else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we get started, let&#8217;s briefly explain what Hive OS is. </span></p>
<h2>What is Hive OS?</h2>
<p>Hive OS is <b>an operating system developed on top of the popular Linux distro, Ubuntu</b>. Let&#8217;s just say that it is a modified version of Ubuntu. Its main mission is to provide you with a convenient interface for mining cryptocurrencies on GPU and managing your rigs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1188" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1188" style="width: 502px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1188 size-full" title="Hive OS App for Android" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_6149.jpg" alt="Hive OS App for Android" width="502" height="960" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_6149.jpg 502w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_6149-157x300.jpg 157w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1188" class="wp-caption-text">Hive OS App for Android, being used to monitor workers.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hive OS gives you the interface to mine Ethereum and Bitcoin, but network<a class="extlink" href="https://hiveos.farm/statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> usage statistics</a> show that over 70% of miners prefer to use Hive OS to mine ETH. Hive OS also has apps for both Android and iOS, and they can be used to monitor and manage your mining rigs remotely.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we would be taking a closer look at the cost of setting up a Hive OS-powered mining rig versus the gains or profits, which leads us to the ultimate question; <strong>Is Hive OS Worth it?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, let me tell you about a guy named JP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JP got into cryptocurrency mining at the age of 16, he’s 23 now and so that’s about 7 years ago; 2014 to be precise. He and his friend invested their life savings, which was a sum of $100,000 to acquire 100 Ethereum (ETH) miners at the time. They were mining 30 ETH daily. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s economy, that would be worth over a million US dollars per day! Unfortunately, they had to keep reinvesting over 80% of their generated revenue, to foot the cost of operating the miners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, an uninterrupted supply of the appropriate quantity of power (emphasis on ‘</span><b>appropriate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’) and stable, unrestricted access to the internet are the major resources needed to start mining. Good news, 5G will definitely soon go viral and make its way into developing nations (If you happen to live in one).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you acquire your hardware (as your budget may permit you), you have to <a class="extlink" href="https://hiveos.farm/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">begin the installation of Hive OS</a> on your miner. The Hive OS installer is available for both Windows, Mac and Linux, however, Hive OS itself is a linux-based operating system. It is a modified version of the Ubutu Linux distro. So your mining rig would always need to be booted into HiveOS to use it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A piece of warning; the learning curve is steep — You&#8217;ll have to become accustomed to words like GPU, ASIC, PXE, Hive OS Deploy, Block, Block Reward, Cloud Mining, <strong>Hash Rate, </strong>Mining Pool, Confirmations etc.  </span></p>
<p>To start mining Hive OS, here are some non-negotiable requirements/expenses;</p>
<h2>Mining Rig</h2>
<p>A mining rig is <b>a computer system used for mining cryptocurrencies</b>. A mining rig might be a specialised computer that does no other work than to mine crypto (e.g the ASICs) or it could otherwise be a computer that fills other needs, such as performing as a gaming system, and is used to mine only on a part-time basis (e.g everyday,  before you retire to bed.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are essentially three kinds of hardware you can use for mining cryptocurrency; </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit Miners)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">GPU (Graphics Processing Units)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPU (Central Processing Units)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HiveOS is only compatible with ASIC and GPU miners, which means investing on a higher end CPU would not result in an increased turnover on Hive OS.  </span></p>

<h2>Broadband Internet</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I’ll start with a list of countries and their average cost of data, to help you put this in perspective. I had to get help from a 2019 study carried out by </span><a class="extlink" href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17247/the-average-cost-of-mobile-data-in-selected-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statista.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><b>The Cost of Mobile Internet Around The World (in U.S. dollars)</b></p>
<figure id="attachment_841" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-841" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-841" title="The Cost of Mobile Internet Around The World" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Cost-of-Mobile-Internet-Around-The-World-.jpeg" alt="The Cost of Mobile Internet Around The World" width="960" height="684" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Cost-of-Mobile-Internet-Around-The-World-.jpeg 960w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Cost-of-Mobile-Internet-Around-The-World--300x214.jpeg 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Cost-of-Mobile-Internet-Around-The-World--768x547.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-841" class="wp-caption-text">The Cost of Mobile Internet Around The World</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Electric Power</h2>
<p>Mining cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum is a GPU-intensive activity. After electric power, the GPUs, also called Graphics Processing Unit are the most important component of your mining setup. The more powerful your GPU is, the higher its hash rate (measured in h/s) would be. The higher your hash rate is, the lesser the time required to complete a &#8220;proof of work&#8221;. To be rewarded, you need a proof of work.</p>
<p>Your hash rate can be drastically increased by using multiple GPUs in a rig. Unfortunately GPUs are power-hungry devices. A single GPU can consume up to 300W. They also produce a lot of heat in the process. Your PSU (or Power Supply Unit) is also an important factor to consider. Its capacity has to be enough for the energy requirements of the GPUs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright, now that you are able to envision the relationship between GPUs, PSUs, and Electricity Usage, let’s examine the cost of electric power in the following countries. </span></p>
<p><b>Electricity prices in U.S. dollars per kilowatt hour</b></p>
<figure id="attachment_1024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1024" style="width: 1618px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1024" title="Screenshot 2021 09 12 at 8.40.04 PM" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-12-at-8.40.04-PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2021 09 12 at 8.40.04 PM" width="1618" height="1186" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-12-at-8.40.04-PM.png 1618w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-12-at-8.40.04-PM-300x220.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-12-at-8.40.04-PM-1024x751.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-12-at-8.40.04-PM-768x563.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-12-at-8.40.04-PM-1536x1126.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1618px) 100vw, 1618px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1024" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Statista, 2021. (If your country is not listed, please, click <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/263492/electricity-prices-in-selected-countries/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> to see full report)</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="http://whattomine.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whattomine.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a tool that helps with calculating your profitability. This is very helpful if you wish to have an idea of how long it&#8217;ll take for you to break even with your current setup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then HiveOS offers something worth considering; MSKMINER is one of the largest and most experienced developers of firmware for Antminers. They offer an entire lineup on Antminer firmware, and provide very fast support for ASIC owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hive OS on the other hand, is the most popular system for managing and monitoring workers. With it, you can actually be assured of stability, 24/7 support service system, and a seamless management of even the largest farms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an Avengers-like combo, MSKMINER and HiveOS decided to collaborate. This gave birth to what we now call the <a class="extlink" href="https://hiveos.farm/asic/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hiveon ASIC firmware powered by MSKMINER.</a></span></p>
<p>With this supercharged firmware, you&#8217;d get up to 80.1 Terahashes per second. That&#8217;s crazy!</p>
<figure id="attachment_1071" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1071" style="width: 2334px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1071" title="HiveOS and MSKMINER" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM.png" alt="HiveOS and MSKMINER" width="2334" height="696" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM.png 2334w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM-300x89.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM-1024x305.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM-768x229.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM-1536x458.png 1536w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-13-at-5.47.01-AM-2048x611.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2334px) 100vw, 2334px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1071" class="wp-caption-text">HiveOS and MSKMINER</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S17+ model is reported to deliver up to 95Th/s with a Standard PSU. It provides its users with incredibly higher hashrate of up to 95Th/s, reliable security, and numerous monitoring features for free (Hive OS is free of charge for Hiveon ASIC firmware users). With this increased hashrate, you could mine more cryptocurrencies, in less time. </span></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, back to the original question we’re trying to answer; <strong>is HiveOS worth it? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the following;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your choice of hardware; ASIC or GPU-based miners?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your location; which invariably determines the availability and cost of uninterrupted power supply and broadband internet. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your $3 monthly fee for each of your workers (Hive OS requires that you pay a monthly fee of $3 if you are using more than 4 workers.)<br />
<strong>💡TIP: A worker</strong> is a term used to describe any type of mining hardware that is supported by Hive OS: a rig — a computer built with GPUs; and ASIC.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>With all the factors highlighted above, I will leave you to decide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">TLDR;</span></strong>
With a potential viewing and followership of over 12 million Africans daily and over 87% of that crowd being between 18 &amp; 35 years of age, the <strong>Big Brother Season 6; Shine Ya Eye</strong> is definitely a humongous publicity opportunity. An opportunity <strong><em>Abeg</em></strong> is leveraging well through its sponsorship deal with the platform. So well, the <strong><em>Abeg Naira</em></strong> is the official in-house currency of the housemates; that’s what they spend.</pre>



<p>It’s being scientifically proven that you remember names, better and more aptly than you do numbers.</p>



<p>Now, which fintech platform is utilizing this proven scientific fact for the good of their users?</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">Abeg!</span></strong></p>



<p>It’s the sixth season of the biggest reality TV show on the African continent right now, and there’s more mind-blowing gist than the usual in-house fights, love, and heartbreak and betrayal stories. And for the first time, the spotlight is shared by the sponsors (it’s usually all about the housemates only).</p>



<p>This sponsor is <strong><em>Abeg</em></strong>.</p>



<p>Wait, wait, wait, what?!</p>



<p>Okay, let me fill you in from the beginning.</p>



<p>In a land of myth and a time of…scratch that!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-1-abeg-naira-in-naira">What is 1 Abeg Naira in Naira?</h2>



<p>This is a question on the lips of many — especially those who are just new to the show. Now, let&#8217;s settle it; The Abeg Naira is a currency that only has an intrinsic value in the Big Brother House.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video aligncenter"><video src="https://github.com/branditechture/branditechture.github.io/raw/master/static-assets/IMG_5512.mp4" controls="controls" width="300" height="150"></video>
<figcaption>Big Brother Housemate, Cross counting his Abeg Nairas.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Based on the terms of the 2bn Naira sponsorship deal, the Abeg Naira is the only supported currency in the Big Brother House, and it was designed to be used to purchase items by the Big Brother Season 6 Housemates.</p>



<p>Nice brand awareness strategy, I&#8217;d say.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video aligncenter"><video src="https://github.com/branditechture/branditechture.github.io/raw/master/static-assets/IMG_5513.mp4" controls="controls" width="300" height="150"></video>
<figcaption>The Housemates doing some shopping with their Abeg Naira</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Abeg Nairas cannot be exhanged with fiat currency, so there is no basis of comparison with the Nigerian Naira. Abeg Naira has to be earned by the housemates via rewards from sponsored tasks, thus effectively making some housemates richer than others.</p>



<p>As for how much 1 Abeg Naira is valued against the Naira, you’d be asking the wrong question.</p>



<p>The phrase &#8220;Abeg Naira&#8221; may however see a subsequent use and popular adoption after the show is over, but that’d be something to definitely watch out for (who knows what cofounders Muheez Akanni and Dare Adekoya are up to?).</p>



<h2 id="h-what-inspired-the-abeg-app">What inspired the abeg app?</h2>



<p>Founded in 2019, Abeg Technologies is a team of vibrant youngsters led by the 26 year old <strong>Dare Adekoya;</strong> a talented product developer who designed the Abeg app as a response to a tweet by <strong><em>Asemota,</em></strong> sent to him by his friend <strong><em>Early Attoh</em></strong> on Dec 30, 2018, which read;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“I think one should build an app in Nigeria similar to $Cash and call it $Abeg. Bambiala culture is international.”</p>
<cite><strong>— Asemota</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>According to Dare, he just wanted to quickly flex his design skills and do something badass with the Abeg idea. The plan was to post it hoping it could trend. So, he started working on the mini task, but unplanned, he fell in love with the logo and the rest is as we see, is unfolding.</p>



<p>Abeg App offers an alternative to bank transactions, which are usually besieged by several network issues and very importantly, exterminates the need for account numbers or any other details that usually proves difficult to remember for most folks. Yes. The Abeg app uses usernames known as abegtags instead of account numbers. The only information required to sign up on the platform, is the phone number integrated with the user’s preregistered Bank Verification Number (BVN).</p>



<p>Making the younger demographics of the country its target market, the Abeg app has a user-friendly interface that the average Nigerian youth will relate to easily with the integration of the colloquial phrase used to beg for favors; <em><strong>“Abeg”</strong></em>.</p>



<p>In the same vein, Abeg allows users to gift their friends’ money, organize giveaways for their followers, conduct fundraisers and earn approval badges and score points for their display of generosity. The app also adopts an extensive use of emojis and sticker features to gain the interest of the younger demographic.</p>



<p>As amazing as this app seems, Abeg is not the first fintech in the Nigerian market — There is already a domineering competition in the country and in the African tech market: <strong>Paga App</strong> with over 15.8M users as of June 2020, <strong>Cowrywise, </strong>handling over 220,000 users as of January 2021, <strong>Paystack</strong> serving over 60,000 users as of October 2020 and <strong>Kuda Bank,</strong> who just rounded up a successful series B serving over 1.4M users as of July 2021. However, Abeg App now has now implemented a marketing strategy that none of these fintech companies have used: <strong>Big Brother Season 6; Shine Ya Eye.</strong></p>



<h2>Headline Sponsorship</h2>



<p><strong>Abeg</strong> is the <strong><a class="extlink" href="https://africamagic.dstv.com/show/big-brother-naija/news/multichoice-unveils-abeg-as-s6-headline-sponsor-bbnaija/news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Headline Sponsor</a></strong> of Big Brother Naija Season 6 while the Associate Sponsor is <strong>PATRICIA.</strong></p>



<p>Rumor has it that <strong>PATRICIA</strong> paid about 1 Billion Naira whilst <strong>Abeg</strong> paid a whooping 2 Billion Naira (no, not Abeg Naira; actual Naira).</p>



<p>As such, a host of other brands including <em><strong>Payporte</strong></em>, <strong><em>Pepsi</em></strong> and <strong><em>Heritage Bank</em></strong> amongst others, dive into the sponsorship opportunities on Big Brother Season 6, to educate the public about their products/services.</p>

<p>Last year, Betway was rumored to have paid over 1Bn Naira in total sponsorship money for the 2020 edition tagged <strong>Big Brother Season 5; Lockdown</strong>.</p>



<p>But for a startup that’s less than 3 years old, the headline sponsorship for the Big Brother Naija season 6, <strong>Abeg</strong>, has left many to wonder about the brand’s revenue generation strategies, the product, and its co-founders.</p>
