										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CryptoTab is a modified version of the popular Chrome Browser. The browser is also powered by Chromium – which is the same engine that Google Chrome Browsers run on. The Browser looks and feels almost identical to the famous Chrome Browser. In fact, the same Chrome extensions can be installed on the CryptoTab Browser. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of the time of this writing, The software (i.e. CryptoTab Browser) is available for Windows and macOS. It is also available for iOS and Android devices.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>Click <a class="extlink" href="https://cryptobrowser.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HERE</a> to Visit CryptoTab&#8217;s Download Page.</p>

<h2>Why was CryptoTab Developed?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since the invention of Blockchain Technology, and the creation of the first Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), a special set of people known as miners has remained crucial for the authentication and addition of new blocks to the blockchains. And the key motivator of these miners has always been fat rewards (given in form of cryptocurrencies) whenever they successfully mine a block first. However, mining blocks for a blockchain is no small task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the cryptographic nature of blockchains – which requires machines to perform very complicated and difficult computations – it required very powerful machines. But as the number of miners in the networks increased, the probability of being the first to validate a block became increasingly difficult, which meant individual miners began to find it next to impossible to mine blocks – especially those who do not have powerful machines. But then CryptoTab creators came up with an ingenious idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By integrating a special Proof of Work algorithm called CryptoNight into the CryptoTab Browser, they were able to aggregate the resources (i.e. Processing Power) of several machines (Smart Phones, Personal Computers, Tablets, etc.) which had the Browser installed to mine Monero Privacy Coins and reward each individual who agreed to contribute to the success by installing the CryptoTab Browser. Though the Monero Privacy Coins are first converted to Bitcoins before being paid to the miners (i.e. Users of CryptoTab Browser).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was essentially a way to enable anyone, with any device to mine Cryptocurrencies – cheaply&#8230;at least, that was the message that was pushed by the creators of CrytpoTab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CryptoTab browsers are supposed to enable less powerful machines to mine Cryptocurrencies without slowing down their operation or performance. Though, the Miner also has the option to increase the mining speed, by increasing the number of resources allocated to the Browser (although doing this could slowdown devices, and drain batteries quickly).</span></p>
<h2><b>Is CryptoTab Browser Safe?</b></h2>
<p>CryptoTab comes in two variants; The free (ordinary) browser and the paid (Pro) version (which costs about $2.50 as of the time of this writing). Being available in the Google PlayStore, and Apple Store, the App is most likely free from viruses and isn’t particularly harmful to devices. Though, you should exercise caution when downloading the software from any third-party website, in order not to download an infected software</p>
<p><strong>Also Read:<a href="https://branditechture.com/is-nicehash-worth-it/"> Is NiceHash Worth It?</a></strong></p>
<h2><b>Benefits Of CryptoTab</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, users of the CryptoTab browser don’t have to do anything out of the ordinary. They would simply have to install the browser, and earn Bitcoins for using the browser (to surf the internet, stream videos, or just let it run in the background&#8230;). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, users can decide to leverage the Affiliate program CryptoTab provides to multiply their earnings. In this case, all a user has to do is invite other people to use the CryptoTab browser. From then, a certain percent of the coins mined by their referrals (up to 10 steps deep) would also be paid to them – providing a sort of passive income for the person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, on paper, the perks of using the CryptoTab browser includes</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy, and comfortable user interface: Since the User Interface is similar to that of the Chrome browser, users (who already enjoy using Chrome) would not find it difficult to switch to the new browser.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides cheap mining opportunities. This is because users do not have to pay for powerful machines or set up mining Rigs in other to mine cryptocurrencies.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mining process doesn’t slow down the devices either: According to the creators, the browser only makes use of “unused” resources in the device.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also easy to set up: The heavy lifting – like, the mining algorithms, setup, etc. – has already been taken care of. All a user needs to do is register an account, and activate the mining. Once they generate sufficient funds (which is at least 0.00001 BTC), they can easily transfer them to their wallet.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Large Community: The official website of CryptoTab states that there are more than 25 million users around the globe. And considering the browser has been around for a while, you can easily find answers to a lot of your questions easily on the internet.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Of Bitcoins For Payment: CryptoTab pays in a popular cryptocurrency – i.e. Bitcoin – making it easy for users to withdraw the coins into their wallets and easily make use of it without needing to convert it first </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Referral/Affiliate Program: The referral program provides users the possibility of earning passively. The referral program is also legal, and well structured.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is not only great reviews with this App. </span></p>
<h2><b>CryptoTab Reviews</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One notorious complaint is that the earning potentials are too small, and takes way too long. In essence, although it provides easy, stress-free earrings, it won’t necessarily make you rich. To counter this limitation, there are options to buy Cloud Boosts packs, which then increase the mining speeds. And some others take to installing the CryptoTab across multiple devices at once in order to multiply their earnings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the reviews online, and the few people I’ve come in contact with, CryptoTab really does payout; however, the people crushing it on the platform are those who are great at recruiting new users. In fact, this very option is pushed so much so that you are promised bonuses such as a free 2X boost (in mining speed) if you refer 2 users.</span></p>
<h2><b>Does CryptoTab Really Mine Bitcoin?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I took a deeper look into the browser, I realized that it didn’t really seem to use the device resources for the mining process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I figured this out by juxtaposing two distinct smartphones. When I did this, I noticed that both smartphones with very different specs (i.e. one with very high specs, and another with very low specs) all mined at relatively the same speed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, even when you turn off the internet connection, the mining just continues – as though the whole animation and counting was just a smokescreen, misleading us into believing something is really happening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also noticed that the mining speed seems to increase when you start referring more and more people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, from observation, I realized that;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was those who were actively recruiting others – and earning commissions in the process – that was making the most money from CryptoTab (not those with powerful devices)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">CryptoTab also makes a lot of money selling Cloud boosts, to those who wish to mine Bitcoin, but are not great at recruiting. So if you’re asking, “how does CryptoTab make money?” there is your answer. Though, the probability of breaking even (i.e. making back your money) from using the Cloud Boosts alone might be precarious.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The browser tries to get as much User Information as possible – demanding that they sign up with their Google account, and requests more and more permission from the user’s Google account, which they’d have to agree to, or forfeit using the service. And, in case you don’t know&#8230;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your personal data (after being collected) could be used or sold – this is how those annoying Ads manage to follow you around the internet. Though I’m not saying they sell your information, you should know that they do collect it, and businesses seldom collect what they don’t use.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Is CryptoTab Legit?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all these observations, one cannot say that CryptoTab is a scam, a Ponzi Scheme, or a Pyramid scheme; but it really does adopt an MLM structure. And whilst most MLM (i.e. Multi-Level Marketing) is not illegal, one should always proceed with caution – because they often hide more work than they present upfront.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, you can start earning Bitcoins from CryptoTab, but you should be ready to do more than just downloading and installing the CryptoTab browser.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Quick Overview:</strong> Ever since the invention of Blockchain by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, interest in the technology has steadily risen, particularly towards the opportunities it brought in regards to wealth. At first, early adopters hopped on the opportunity and started making good money from the New Tech by becoming miners for the network and earning commissions. But as more and more people poured into the system, competition would get bloody, and people would start teaming up, and soon things like pools, and consequently, NiceHash would emerge. But, due to high volatility and perilous hacks and thefts, a lot of people are now wary, and super cautious about Startups in the Crypto industry. Hence the question, “is NiceHash worth it?”</span></p>

<h2>What is NiceHash?</h2>
<p>NiceHash is a cryptocurrency<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hash-power-hash-rate" class="extlink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> hash power</a> marketplace that connects sellers of hashing power with buyers of hashing power using the sharing economy approach. The company was founded in Slovenia by Marko Kobal and Matjaž Škorjanc in the year 2014.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing to understand is the nature of the market NiceHash exists in, and the opportunity they leverage to build their business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is, ever since the invention of Blockchain technology, there has been an increased need for computational power. This is because the current Blockchain framework relies on the ability of a network of computers <strong>to process hashed, and decrypt encrypted data</strong> – two tasks that are very difficult and exhaustive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, the Blockchain is a distributed ledger to which anyone in the network has access. However, to maintain the “integrity” of the Blockchain, some users are tasked to do a certain amount of work in order to verify that any new information that is being inputted into the network is authentic. This demand for work is a way the system uses to deter attackers who might have the wish to alter the records. </span></p>
<h2><b>What is Hashing and Hash Rate?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the sake of security, information (or Blocks) in a Blockchain Network, are not just encrypted – i.e. made impossible to be understood by anyone for who the information was not meant for – but also hashed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, a piece of encrypted information (or block) can be decrypted using an encryption key. But, this also meant that if the key falls into the wrong hands, all the information (or blocks) is compromised. However, when a hashed block is compromised, only a representation of the information (i.e. a Hash Value) is exposed, and not the information in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s not all. The Hash itself is also very tricky to discover. This is because when a piece of information is hashed, and a hashed version of the information is produced, there is no way of getting back, or guessing, the original information from that hashed information – just like you can’t get back wood from its ash. Hence, it takes a lot of trial and errors to guess the right data that generated that Hashed information. This trial and error are called computation, and until the machine “guesses” the correct hash, the Blockchain network would not accept any new block.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is to say, a Blockchain wraps a piece of encrypted information inside a hash function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why, very powerful computers are usually needed to carry out these iterations – which can run into hundreds of very complicated calculations, most times leading to wrong answers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, the hash rate (of a machine or network) refers to the number of times attempts are made to complete those calculations each and every second. This hash rate is measured in Units of hash per second. Machines with a high hash power are highly efficient and powerful and can process a lot of data in a single second. Hence, more hash rates (aka Computational Power, Processors, GPU, etc.), equals more chances of success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: The process of using Machine Processing Power to validate blocks in a blockchain is also referred to as “Proof of Work” (PoW).</span></p>
<pre><strong>Have you heard about Hive OS? Read; <a href="https://branditechture.com/is-hive-os-worth-it/">Is Hive OS Worth It?</a></strong></pre>
<h2><b>Why Was NiceHash Created?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the nature of the task at hand, miners needed very powerful machines, but they also consumed monstrous amounts of energy in order to carry out these calculations fast. And the problem was, if you are not the first to predict the right hash, and validate the block, then there is no reward for your efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a lot of Blocks to mine, more and more people poured into the Networks, and they all came with their very, very powerful machines – some even setting up humongous mining rigs (i.e. very powerful machines that are interconnected for the sole purpose of carrying out a difficult computational task).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, it became extremely improbable to be the one to find hash, or validate the blocks first – since much more powerful and faster computers were already in the race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To counter this, miners started aggregating resources, by forming Pools. That way they were able to have a better chance of being the first to validate more blocks, and also get rewards. This group of miners simply shared the reward according to the amount of computational power each contributed to the Pool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And remember, since it was getting increasingly difficult to mine, miners were beginning to crave more and more powerful computers to do the mining – it was an uphill battle for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But NiceHash had other plans. They wanted to make finding hashes nicer for everyone. Hence the name, NiceHash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creators of NiceHash thought to themselves, “what if an individual doesn’t have these powerful machines, and didn’t even want to dedicate their personal machines to mining; but wanted to mine blocks and be rewarded in cryptocurrencies, how would they do it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, NiceHash came up with an ingenious idea of setting up a sort of “shared economy” and it killed two birds at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side Note: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In economics (particularly capitalism), sharing economy refers to a system in which people with the means to do a job (for a client), offer their services (to that client), and are paid for it. That is to say, it enables the sharing (or proper usage) of excess capacity – by giving (the people in need) access to the resources, whilst rewarding the owners of the resources. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is to say, in a shared economy, Buyers are those who pay for resources (or Capacity), whilst Sellers are those who own the resources (or Capacity).</span></i></p>
<h2><b>How NiceHash Works: </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea (for NiceHash) was simple: Buyers decide on their needs (i.e. the specific coin they wish to mine), pick a Pool (i.e. a group of miners) to mine it, then state the price they are willing to pay the Pool for the job. If the Pool accepts the offer, they go ahead and mine the coin. After which the coin would be handed over to the Buyer, and the Money would be handed over to the Sellers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This meant, Buyers didn’t have to have powerful Machines to mine coins anymore, and Miners are assured a fair wage for their powerful computers – i.e. their assets. Of course, in all these NiceHash, being the aggregator/platform would charge both Buyers and Sellers a small fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In simple terms; NiceHash serves as an online marketplace for buying and selling of computer processing/hashing power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NiceHash launched in April 2014 and has quickly grown to become the largest hash power marketplace in the world, with more than 170,000 miners, 3.3 million orders served, and over 181,000 BTC paid out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question now is, is it worth Buying or Selling on NiceHash?</span></p>
<h2><b>Is NiceHash Worth It?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Objectively looking at the platform, you will find that it offers a wide range of services and features to make things very easy for both Buyers and Sellers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of its features include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Compatibility: users do not need dedicated crypto mining hardware because it can utilize the little GPU/CPU/Processing power that their Personal Computers already have. If you own an AMD or Nvidia card, all you need to do is to install the free NiceHash Miner software.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ease of Usage: The service is intuitive and easy to use; This very feature is mostly appreciated by users who are entirely new to crypto mining and trading.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Neat Interface: The simplicity of the User Interface is also commendable. It is uncluttered, comprehensive, and also intuitive. The central dashboard shows you your current mining activities, devices connected, and even your balances, giving you an at-a-glance overview of your portfolio.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial set up: The process of registering, and setting up a NiceHash account is simple, and can be done within 15 minutes</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Anonymity: Sellers don’t even need to register at all if they prefer to remain anonymous. And Buyers are able to begin ordering hashpower immediately after they register.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Profitability Calculator: The website also includes a profitability calculator. This calculator can help you predict the amount of mining you can practically carry out, hence allowing you to better weigh your options.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Autopilot: After initial setup, the system can pretty much work on its own – needing almost no monitoring.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatic Switching: The software also has a brilliant algorithm that automatically determines which coins are worth mining based on their profitability (at a particular time).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick And Easy Exchange: Users can also sell their coins on an integrated exchange that is available on NiceHash, thereby eliminating the need to transfer their funds to an external exchange before carrying out transactions or trading.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Access To Extra hash power: If you have a huge target to hit and need a lot of hashpower, you do not have to get an expensive dedicated machine to do it, as NiceHash enables you to rent additional hash power without needing to upgrade your hardware.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Assorted Pools: Thanks to the popularity of NiceHash, Buyers can easily find a wide range of Pools dedicated to mining several types of coins.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ASIC support: If you have the money to get dedicated mining hardware, you’d also be glad to know that NiceHash supports it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Other Factors To Consider About NiceHash:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virus Threat: Trying to install the NiceHash software on your Personal Computer will most likely bring up the Virus Threat notification. But this is only because Anti-Virus Programs usually flag CPU mining software like Viruses, due to past histories of Malwares secretly installing CPU miners in order to use people CPU’s (for mining) without their permission – slowing down their devices in the process.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NiceHash Fees: As stated earlier, certain fees are charged for carrying out transactions within the platform (this is what keeps the platform running). To prevent spamming, a fee of 0.0001 BTC is first charged for each transaction, plus 3% of the total amount spent on the order. But for a sale of power, if the balance is less than or above 0.1 BTC, 5%, or 3% are charged respectively. Please note that these fees may change from time to time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NiceHash Affiliate Program: NiceHash also has an Affiliate program available to users. However, you would have to go through rigorous scrutiny before being accepted, and given the materials to work with. Anyway, your potential earnings will be about 5% of all funds generated by the people you invited. There are also bonuses available in the Affiliate program.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>How Long Will GPU Mining Be Profitable? (Would NiceHash Be Profitable In 2022, And The Future?)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of Blockchain technology indicates a shift from “Proof of Work” to “Proof Of Stake”. This implies that the major commodity traded on the platform – i.e. Hashing Power – might be obsolete in the not so far future. The result would be a dramatic decline in demand (Buyers), as well as supply (Sellers). The business model of NiceHash would be effectively dead by then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is still hope. If NiceHash figures out a way to also switch up the commodity being traded – i.e. to start selling Stakes, rather than Hashing Power – they may still have a chance. </span></p>

<h2><b>Is NiceHash Reliable? (My Verdict on NiceHash)</b></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1233 size-full" title="Nicehash Hacked" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nicehash-Hacked.jpg" alt="Nicehash Hacked" width="1000" height="688" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nicehash-Hacked.jpg 1000w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nicehash-Hacked-300x206.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nicehash-Hacked-768x528.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 6th of December, 2017; roughly<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16748472/nicehash-cryptocurrency-mining-bitcoin-ethereum-hacking-security-breach" target="_blank" class="extlink" rel="nofollow noopener"> 63 million US Dollars were stolen from NiceHash’s account by hackers</a>. Two weeks later, users of NiceHash discovered (to their shock) that Matjaž Škorjanc (the Company’s Chief Technology Officer), was once arrested, and imprisoned (for almost 5 years), after committing multiple Cybercrimes – including the creation of Mariposa (Aka Butterfly Bot), a virus that infected over 1 million computers (monitoring and stealing passwords, bank credentials, and credit card details). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the news (about the hack and crimes) was beginning to make headlines, the CEO and co-founder of the company, Marko Kobal, resigned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This resulted in a lot of users losing trust in the company – and a lot of users are still very cautious to date. Needless to say, the platform offers a lot of benefits, but in a market where things move quickly, and anonymity is common, one needs to thread as though the floor were a layer of thin ice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the worth of the company is based on your level of experience and needs. That is to say if you are interested in mining and trading cryptocurrencies, but lack experience – and just wish to get your feet wet – then NiceHash is likely worth your consideration.</span></p>
