<p>In this article, I will show you how to generate very beautiful static websites using WordPress and how you can host and plug them to a custom domain (www.yourbusiness.com) for free on Github Pages.</p>
<p>I am about to share a secret that I have used to save my clients a lot of money, keep their website blazing fast, secure, and maintenance-free.</p>



<p>The secret: I build their websites on localhost using WordPress, then I generate a static HTML version of the website and host it on GitHub Pages. To ensure the website loads over HTTPS, I use the SSL provided with the Cloudflare Free Plan.</p>





<p>With WordPress, you have <a class="extlink" href="https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hundreds of thousands of free and premium themes</a> and <a class="extlink" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">plugins</a> to choose from. You can also build your own custom templates using Elementor Pro.</p>
<pre><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>TIP:</strong></span>  If you want to see a full list of the <a href="https://branditechture.com/when-to-choose-a-static-website-over-a-dynamic-website-and-why-you-should/">advantages of using static websites</a>, quickly glance through <a href="https://branditechture.com/when-to-choose-a-static-website-over-a-dynamic-website-and-why-you-should/">this post</a> and come back here.</pre>







<h2 id="h-prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<h2>2. Create Github Repository</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to create a repository (or repo) from which your website would be served.</p>



<p>To do this, you first have to <strong><a class="extlink" href="https://github.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">create a Github account</a></strong> if you don&#8217;t have one.</p>



<p>After logging in, create a repo with name of your website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="704" height="350" class="wp-image-564" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.42.21-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 09 02 at 12.42.21 PM" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.42.21-PM.png 704w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.42.21-PM-300x149.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /></figure>



<p>Click on the <strong>New</strong> button coloured green.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1014" height="1024" class="wp-image-565" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.44.32-PM-1014x1024.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 09 02 at 12.44.32 PM" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.44.32-PM-1014x1024.png 1014w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.44.32-PM-297x300.png 297w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.44.32-PM-150x150.png 150w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.44.32-PM-768x775.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-12.44.32-PM.png 1254w" sizes="(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px" /></figure>



<p>Put the name of your website In the text field under <strong>Repository name *</strong>.</p>



<p>As explained earlier, a repo acts like a folder that will hold the website&#8217;s source files. I named mine <strong>&#8220;my staticwebsite&#8221;</strong> but you can give yours any name.</p>



<h2 id="h-3-install-github-desktop">3. Install Github Desktop</h2>



<p>I am a busy <a class="extlink" href="https://dribbble.com/designeryusuf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Graphic Designer</a> with a phobia for command line errors so I avoid Git CLI. I prefer to use Github Desktop instead.</p>



<p>If you are someone who doesn&#8217;t like Command Line Interface like me, <a class="extlink" href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Github Desktop</a> is a very good alternative to Git CLI.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="540" class="wp-image-566" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-1.36.37-PM-min-1024x540.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 09 02 at 1.36.37 PM min" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-1.36.37-PM-min-1024x540.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-1.36.37-PM-min-300x158.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-1.36.37-PM-min-768x405.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-1.36.37-PM-min-1536x809.png 1536w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-1.36.37-PM-min-2048x1079.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>To Install Github Desktop, Go to <a class="extlink" href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desktop.github.com</a>. Click on the big purple <strong>Download for [Your OS]</strong> button to <strong>download</strong> the installer, then install it on your machine.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-create-an-offline-clone-of-your-repo">4. Create An Offline Clone of Your Repo</h2>



<p>Luckily, Github Desktop allows us to <strong>clone</strong> repositories to our local drives, so we will use it to clone the repo we just created.</p>



<p>It will also <strong>track and sync changes</strong> to files in the repo;<strong> both on Github.com and your local offline copy</strong> (which is basically a folder).</p>



<p>To clone the repo we created on Github.com;</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Github Desktop</li>
<li>Sign in with the same Github account which you used to <strong>create a repo</strong> in <strong>step 2</strong>. To sign in, click <strong>Github </strong>&gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Sign In</strong> under <strong>Github.com</strong> (Not Enterprise). But if you use Windows, then that would be <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Options </strong>&gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Sign In</strong></li>
<li>After successful authentication, it&#8217;s time to clone the repo we had created earlier on to our local storage. To do that, go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Clone Repository</strong>. You will notice an option to choose a <strong>local path</strong> to clone to. Create a Folder named <strong>Github</strong> in your <strong>Documents</strong> folder. and choose to clone your repo into it. Your local path should look something like <strong>/Users/apple/Documents/Github/</strong><em>mystaticwebsite</em></li>
<li>After setting your local path, choose the repo you created in <strong>Step 2</strong> and click on the <strong>Clone</strong> button on the lower right corner of the modal.</li>
</ol>



<p>If everything goes well, you should have a local version of your repo in Documents &gt; Github (depending on the local path set above)</p>

<h2 id="h-5-install-mamp">5. Install MAMP</h2>



<p>MAMP is a local web development solution that allows us to develop PHP-powered websites on a local machine without having to purchase a <a class="extlink" href="https://support.branditechture.agency/docs/what-is-website-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web hosting</a> plan.</p>



<p>WordPress is powered by PHP, hence to create a WordPress website with our local machine, we would need a local server such as the one MAMP offers.</p>



<p>To download and install MAMP, go to <a class="extlink" href="https://mamp.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mamp.info</a> and click on the ⬇️<strong> Free Download</strong> button. Wait for download to complete and install on your computer as usual.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="467" class="wp-image-572" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-6.53.07-AM-min-1024x467.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 09 03 at 6.53.07 AM min" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-6.53.07-AM-min-1024x467.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-6.53.07-AM-min-300x137.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-6.53.07-AM-min-768x350.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-6.53.07-AM-min-1536x701.png 1536w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-6.53.07-AM-min-2048x934.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now that you have installed MAMP. It is time to Install WordPress on your local machine. Which takes us to the next step.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-install-wordpress">6. Install WordPress</h2>



<p>Installing WordPress is a little bit tricky for beginners because the process is not the same on Windows and Mac. This is due to the varying directory structure on both OS, and maybe the subtle differences between the MAMP UI on both platforms.</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to <a class="extlink" href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wordpress.org/download</a> and scroll down until you see the Download Wordpress button.</li>
<li>Download the WordPress .zip archive by clicking on the button.</li>
</ol>



<p>Follow the guide below for a step by step installation of WordPress for your OS;</p>

</ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>TIP:</strong> You can also use any existing WordPress installation; whether on localhost or on a live server.</pre>



<h2 id="h-7-generate-static-html-files-from-wordpress">7. Generate Static HTML Files From WordPress</h2>



<p>There are a few other plugins that can do this, but I found the <strong>Simply Static</strong> plugin to be very straightforward.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-577 size-full" title="Screen Shot 2021 09 03 at 2.09.16 PM" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-2.09.16-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 09 03 at 2.09.16 PM" width="1914" height="870" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-2.09.16-PM.png 1914w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-2.09.16-PM-300x136.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-2.09.16-PM-1024x465.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-2.09.16-PM-768x349.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-03-at-2.09.16-PM-1536x698.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1914px) 100vw, 1914px" /></p>



<p>From your WordPress Admin</p>



<p>Go to <strong>Plugins</strong> &gt;&gt;<strong> Add new</strong></p>



<p>Search for “<a class="extlink" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simply Static</a>”. <strong>Install</strong> and <strong>activate</strong> it.</p>
<p>Copy the directory path of your repo and paste it as shown in the screenshot below;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-586 size-full" title="Simply Static Settings" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simply-Static-Settings.png" alt="Simply Static Settings" width="1548" height="1390" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simply-Static-Settings.png 1548w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simply-Static-Settings-300x269.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simply-Static-Settings-1024x919.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simply-Static-Settings-768x690.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Simply-Static-Settings-1536x1379.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1548px) 100vw, 1548px" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>Save Changes. </strong></p>
<p>Now, <strong>Simply Static</strong> &gt; <strong>Generate </strong>then click <strong>Generate Static Files</strong></p>
<p>If all goes well, your static WordPress site will be exported as static HTML pages in the repo folder path.</p>

<pre>⚠️ The button says <strong>"Publish Branch"</strong> because we want to publish to an <strong>empty</strong> <strong>Github.com </strong>repo. <br /><br />Next time we regenerate our static WordPress file, and want to <strong>Push the changes to Github.com,</strong> the button won't display <strong>Publish Branch</strong>, but <strong>Push Origin.</strong><br /><br />Don't get confused, they both do the same job of pushing your changes to Github. </pre>
<p>Now, it is time to covert our repo from just an ordinary repo to <strong>Github Pages.</strong> To do this, go to <a class="extlink" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/</a>, make sure you are logged in with your account as usual.</p>
<p>Click on the repo we have been working on, then click on <strong>Settings &gt; Pages. </strong>Set your Github Pages branch to <strong>Main </strong>as shown in the screenshot below; </p>

<p>Click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
<p>A link would be autogenerated for you something like <strong>https://you.github.io/yourrepo</strong>.</p>
<pre>⚠️ Clicking on the link may return a <strong>Server not found error</strong>. Why? Because of the <strong>Destination URL settings</strong> we had specified in <strong>Simply Static</strong> <strong>in step 7 above</strong> before generating our static files.  <strong>DO NOT PANIC.</strong></pre>
<p>Our website will not work until we complete the final step below 👇🏾, so you have to be a little bit patient here. </p>
<h1>8. Connect GitHub Pages to Your Namecheap Domain</h1>
<h3>Github Setup</h3>
<p>This part explains how to connect your Namecheap domain to a GitHub Pages repository in GitHub.</p>
<p>Be sure you are on the <strong>Pages</strong> settings of your repository. (<strong>Choose</strong> <strong>Repo </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Pages</strong>)</p>
<p>In the <strong>Custom Domain</strong> box, enter the domain you registered with Namecheap, and click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<pre><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Note:</strong></span> You may notice a new file called CNAME when you return to your repository's <strong>Code</strong> tab. This is completely normal, and it occurs after setting a custom domain. The CNAME is a very important file for your custom domain to work with Github. This file will include just one line of code; which is the domain you added in the Custom Domain Box.</pre>
<h3>Namecheap Setup</h3>
<p>Login to your Namecheap account.</p>
<p>Navigate to the <strong>Domain List</strong> and click on <strong>Manage</strong> to the far right of your domain name.</p>
<p>From there, click on the <strong>Advanced DNS</strong> tab. Click <strong>Add New Record</strong> to add each of the following five records:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper-paragraph">
<table class=" aligncenter">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Host</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>TTL</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>CNAME Record</td>
<td>www</td>
<td>
<p>Your GitHub pages URL</p>
<p>(e.g https://you.github.io/yourrepo)</p>
</td>
<td>Automatic</td>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Click <strong>Save All Changes</strong> and delete any additional records that may conflict with those you&#8217;ve just entered.</p>
<p>Please give approximately <strong>30 minutes</strong> for the changes to go into effect. </p>
<p>Congratulations! You have just successfully deployed a static WordPress Website with a custom domain, free forever on Github Pages!</p>
<p>You should now be able to access the content in your GitHub Pages repository from the custom domain you registered with Namecheap.</p>

<p>Websites can be built using a variety of languages; programming, markup, and markdown languages. They come in different sizes and shapes, but no matter what, a website is either <strong>static</strong> or <strong>dynamic</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>What is a Static Website?</strong></p>



<p>A static website is the most basic form of website. It is rendered on the browser exactly as stored, and nothing changes on a per-user basis. This means that the same content is served for every user.</p>



<p><strong>What is a Dynamic Website?</strong></p>



<p>A dynamic website is the type of website that renders the webpage <strong>at the time of request</strong>. Dynamic websites are usually built using one or more programming languages and they feature a database. They support features like user authentication, personalisation, per-user preferences, e-commerce, cookies etc.</p>



<p><strong>Facebook.com</strong> is an example of a dynamic website. The name on my profile, my friends list, my newsfeed etc, will always differ from yours. These variables are generated from a database and rendered at the time of requesting each page.</p>




<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>Need to build a website that truly works? Branditechture Design Agency offers <a class="extlink" href="https://branditechture.agency/lets-build-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bespoke website solutions</a> that you can truly call your own.</strong>

<strong>Click <a class="extlink" href="https://branditechture.agency/lets-build-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HERE</a> to get started ASAP.</strong><strong> </strong></pre>



<h2 id="h-advantages-of-static-websites">Advantages of Static Websites</h2>



<p>You may be tempted to ask, &#8220;with all the awesome features of dynamic websites, why would someone opt for a static website?&#8221; </p>



<p>Well, here are some genuine reasons to choose a static website over a dynamic website;</p>



<ul>
<li>Static websites do not require a database to render pages.</li>
<li>SEO Benefits; Search Engine Crawlers don&#8217;t have a hard time crawling Static HTML websites.</li>
<li>They are not resource-intensive, meaning that they&#8217;ll still respond relatively well on high concurrent usage (i.e The number of multiple website users at any given time).</li>
<li>Static websites are unbelievably fast since no real time server preprocessing is required.</li>
<li>They are secure and maintenance-free, which means static websites are rid of any security vulnerability even if left unmaintained for several years.</li>
<li>The codebase of any static website can be easily read by any human with basic understanding of HTML, CSS &amp; JS, leading to easier bug fixes.</li>
<li>Migrating static websites from one server to another server is relatively easy. It only involves copying the files from one server location to another. No additional steps such as database reconnection would be required.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some of the advantages listed above are hard to ignore, so whenever I am contracted to build a website, I first consider whether or not a static site would be enough to meet my client’s needs, and most of the times, it is. </p>



<h2>Types of websites that can be made static.</h2>



<p>Just in case you are wondering what types of websites can be made static, here are some use cases;</p>



<h3 id="h-1-blog">1. Blog</h3>



<p>This is hard to believe, but static websites can also be used for fully-featured blogs. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="594" class="wp-image-541" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Blog-by-Branditechture-min-e1630570443386-1024x594.png" alt="Blog by Branditechture min" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Blog-by-Branditechture-min-e1630570443386-1024x594.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Blog-by-Branditechture-min-e1630570443386-300x174.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Blog-by-Branditechture-min-e1630570443386-768x445.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Blog-by-Branditechture-min-e1630570443386-1536x890.png 1536w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Blog-by-Branditechture-min-e1630570443386-2048x1187.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />

<p>This blog post you are currently reading is an example of a static blog. This page is originally an HTML file that was rendered as-is. As a matter of fact, no server-side preprocessing was needed. This was made possible by a WordPress plugin called Simply Static &#8211; A WordPress-powered static website generator.</p>



<p>Are you still in doubt? You can verify by copying and pasting this link in your browser; <br />👉🏾 <strong>https://branditechture.com/index.html</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">If you are interested in building your own static blog/website using WordPress, then <strong><a href="https://branditechture.com/free-static-website-hosting-with-namecheap-wordpress-github-pages-and-cloudflare/">read this post.</a> </strong> </pre>



<p><a href="https://branditechture.com/">This blog</a> has Yoast SEO tools, Google Analytics, Dedicated Author Pages, Navigational Menus, and pretty much anything that can be found on any WordPress blog. All thanks to Simply Static, a WordPress Static Site Generator.</p>



<p>Blogs are nothing but content rendered via templates. You don’t need a heavy-weight application to parse every request before rendering a new page.</p>



<p>If you want a fast-loading blog and a customised design in record time, a <a href="https://branditechture.com/free-static-website-hosting-with-namecheap-wordpress-github-pages-and-cloudflare/">static site generated from WordPress</a> is the perfect option for you. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-one-page-website">2. One-page Website</h3>



<p>As opposed to a multi-page website, a single-page website is a website having only one HTML page, which is usually the index-page.</p>



<p>Despite having just a single page, One-page websites can still have navigation menu items that scroll up or down to the target section when clicked on. For easier navigation, the nav bar can be made sticky. </p>



<h3 id="h-3-landing-pages">3. Landing Pages</h3>



<p>If you just launched a new app, but you need a platform to spread the word and feature links to both the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android) versions of the app, you&#8217;ll need is a Landing page.</p>



<p>Landing pages are used to provide information on (and ultimately sell) a certain product or concept. A landing page is similar to a One-page website, but there is no rule restricting it to only one page – It can have dedicated pages for <strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</strong> and <strong>About Us.</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="575" class="wp-image-537" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Abeg-App-Landing-Page-1024x575.png" alt="The Abeg App Landing Page" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Abeg-App-Landing-Page-1024x575.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Abeg-App-Landing-Page-300x169.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Abeg-App-Landing-Page-768x431.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Abeg-App-Landing-Page-1536x863.png 1536w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Abeg-App-Landing-Page-2048x1150.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />

</figure>
</div>



<p>The <a class="extlink" href="https://abeg.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Abeg.app</a> website homepage is a good example of a landing page. </p>



<h3 id="h-4-business-corporate-websites">4. Business/Corporate Websites</h3>



<p>Most businesses employ a brochureware design, which typically involves transferring information on their company brochure on to their official website. Brochureware is the most common type of website in the corporate sector.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="574" class="wp-image-534" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-02-at-8.46.08-AM-1024x574.png" alt="Bostrad - Designed by Branditechture" />

</div>



<p>Business/Corporate websites are typically multi-paged. They reflect the services offered by an organisation or business, and they contain information such as about, testimonials, case studies, portfolio, related images, staff, and a contact page.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-portfolio-and-cv-website">5. Portfolio and CV Website</h3>



<p>A portfolio website displays professional information about an individual or a company and helps showcase their work.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The concept of being able to access collateral-free loans by just downloading an app seems incredible to many Nigerians — This reality has effectively made loan apps the most notable invention of the fastest-growing sector in the tech industry in Nigeria; Fintech.</p>



<p>Loan apps like<strong> Branch, Carbon, Quick Check and FairMoney </strong>have started seeing competition from the likes of <strong>Okash, Soko Loan, 9Credit </strong>etc, as loan apps continue to make their way into the lives of more Nigerians. </p>



<p>As a matter of fact, we have no less than 25 Nigerian loan apps on the Google Play Store.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While this is supposed to be a blessing to the average Nigerian citizen, a considerable majority of these tech firms have further plunged Nigerians into agony&nbsp;— not only financially, but through the <strong>defamation of character.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a financial implication, some salary earners literally<strong><em> work for </em></strong>these loan sharks, no thanks to their super-high interest rate and short-term repayment time. The maximum loan term is usually between 7-30 days, with interest rates as high as 50%! &nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-loan-apps-are-guilty-of-this">What loan apps are guilty of this?</h2>



<p>Based on reviews from users, firsthand experience, and feedbacks on various internet forums, the following apps have been confirmed to derive pleasure in disgracing defaulting customers and even picking up fights before the end of their loan duration;</p>



<ol><li>Sokoloan</li><li>9Credit</li><li>NairaPlus</li><li>Go Cash</li><li>9jaCash</li><li>LionCash</li><li>GMoney </li><li>GetCash</li><li>FastMoney</li><li>ICoin </li></ol>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-if-you-default-on-a-loan">What happens if you default on a loan?</h2>



<p>If you default on a loan, your total amount due would start to increase by 1 &#8211; 2% per day after the due date. </p>



<p>In spite of their humongous interest rates and late fees, these lending platforms take extreme measures in their process of debt recovery, causing harrassment, humiliation and irreparable defamation of character to loan defaulters — Whether your reasons for defaulting are of genuine concern or not, they will send libellous text messages to your contacts; brand you a wanted criminal who ran away with their company’s money. </p>



<p>I consider this measure extreme because long lost friends, family members, bosses, colleagues at work, religious colleagues, and siblings all of whose contacts you have saved to your phone, would be bombarded with demeaning messages about your personality.</p>



<p>In some cases, one is likely to be threatened personally about having their details sent to the Credit Bureau for blacklisting if they fail to make repayment on time. And even before the due date, there are constant phone calls and text messages that can be considered intrusive — all to remind borrowers to make payment before the due date.</p>



<p>Some borrowers have been pushed to the brink of suicide for being humiliated in such irrepairable ways.</p>



<p>For Example, here are screenshots of the messages I got after one of my contacts borrowed money from an app called 9Credit and has failed to pay back after about three weeks passed since the due date.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Other Real Life Experiences As Narrated By Nigerians</h2>



<p>According to a Nairaland user with the username <strong><em>Mrporanir</em>: </strong>&#8220;I blame the Android OS for not regulating them on Play Store, you can never find such apps on the Apple iOS Store. I also blame the CBN for not regulating these loan sharks.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="h-nitda-s-intervention">NITDA&#8217;s Intervention</h2>



<p>Last week, a loan app called Sokoloan was fined 10 Million Naira by the Nigerian Information Technology Development Agency (or NITDA) for their persistent violation of privacy and misuse of users data. According to NITDA’s spokesperson, Hadiza Umar, ​​NITDA had sanctioned Soko Lending Company Limited for invasion of privacy.</p>



<p>This action was taken after receiving a series of complaints by Nigerians against the lending company for unauthorised disclosures, failure to protect customers’ personal data and defamation of character as well as carrying out the necessary due diligence as mandated in the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) which was published in 2019 by NITDA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An excerpt of the statement reads as follows; “One of such complaints filed by <strong><em>Bloomgate Solicitors</em></strong> on behalf of its client, the data subject, was received on Monday, 11th November 2019. NITDA, as part of its due diligence process, commenced investigation over the alleged infractions of the provisions of the NDPR.”</p>



<p>“According to one of the complainants, when he failed to meet up with his repayment obligations due to insufficient credit in his account on the date the direct debit was to take effect, the company unilaterally sent privacy-invading messages to the complainant’s contacts.</p>



<p>“Investigation revealed that the complainant&#8217;s contacts who were neither parties to the loan transaction nor consented to the processing of their data have confirmed the receipt of such messages.”</p>



<p>It continues, “The agency made strident efforts to get Soko Loan to change the unethical practice but to no avail. After the agency’s investigation team secured a lien order on one of the company’s accounts by which it could come up with privacy-enhancing solutions for its business model, Soko Loan decided to rebrand and direct its customers to pay into its other business accounts.”</p>



<p>“The agency’s investigation further revealed that the company embeds trackers that share data with third parties inside its mobile application without providing users information about it or using the appropriate lawful basis.”</p>



<p>For the alleged breaches of privacy, NITDA thereby imposed a monetary sanction of 10 million Naira on Soko Loan.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>While your reasons for wanting a loan might be genuine, I would strongly recommend asking from your friends, family, colleagues or even your clients. By so doing, you&#8217;d not only avoid incurring huge interests on these loan apps, but you&#8217;d also have control over your personal data, thereby avoiding a full-blown defamation of your character by these loan sharks who charge as high as 30% &#8211; 50% for short-term loans.</p>



<p>Try to build a saving culture using an app like <strong><a class="extlink" href="https://www.piggyvest.com/?newref=1&amp;ref=4c48c54ec10419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Piggyvest</a></strong> rather than spend everything that comes your way. This way, you can have some funds to fall back on in cases of emergencies rather than settle for loan sharks, default and face constant humiliation, harassment and threats.</p>



<p>I hope the CBN has plans to eliminate all the insanity currently going on in the fintech sector but till then, let&#8217;s thread safely.</p>



<p>Thank you for reading to this very end. Your comments are welcome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is a growing concern about the level of professionalism in the field of website design and it is becoming quite annoying. In the past, website design used to be an honourable profession and only a few could qualify as a web designer or developer. This is perhaps due to the barriers which were previously associated with accessing web design tools, training, and certifications, but sadly, the industry is now oversaturated with quacks as any Monkey with a laptop and mobile internet access can easily pass for a website designer. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme-1024x768.jpg" alt="Angry Woman and Cat Meme" class="wp-image-232" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme-300x225.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme-768x576.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme.jpg 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>What is the motivation behind this post?</strong></p>



<p>The overwhelming increase in the number of quack web designers on the World Wide Web has now made it very difficult for prospective website owners to avoid playing into the wrong hands. At least, 1 in every 5 website owners fall prey to a quack web designer. That&#8217;s not all — some prospective website owners have been tricked to part ways with their money in exchange for absolutely no value. To this end, I felt the need to do my own part by writing this piece.</p>



<p>I know it is impossible to eradicate this plague, but I want to believe that no one reads these tips and still ends up with a quack.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-request-their-portfolio-and-assess-their-own-website">1. Request their portfolio and assess their own website</h2>



<p>There is no gainsaying that this should be the first thing you should request from any web designer you are looking to hire. However, despite the fact that many people request a portfolio, they still fall prey to quack web designers because they forgot to request their own website. </p>



<p>The most important item on a web designer&#8217;s portfolio is arguably their own website. This is because a quack website designer can easily claim he built any website by just sending you a bunch of web links, but you&#8217;d be more accurate if you judge their capabilities by taking a look at their very own website.  </p>



<p>Take note of the following red flags;</p>



<ul><li>They don&#8217;t have a website.</li><li>They claim their website is under construction.</li><li>Their website loads very slowly.</li><li>Their website lacks content.</li><li>You see some dummy <strong><em>&#8220;Lorem Ipsum&#8221;</em></strong> texts scattered all over the place.</li><li>Unforgivable grammatical errors, both on and off their website.  </li></ul>



<h2 id="h-2-access-yourself-and-prepare-ahead">2. Access yourself and prepare ahead</h2>



<p>As a prospective website owner, it is also important for you to do a personal self-assessment as you are very likely to end up with a quack web designer if one or more of the reasons below apply to you;</p>



<ul><li>You don&#8217;t have an eye for good design.</li><li>You fail to discuss the performance side of your project.</li><li>Your budget is too low.</li><li>You overlook some or all of the red flags.</li></ul>



<p>It is quite simple — before embarking on a search for <a class="extlink" href="https://branditechture.agency/lets-build-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a good web designer,</a> you should at least have some realistic expectations of what you wish to derive from the website in view; both aesthetically and functionally. You can achieve this by browsing through websites that share the same goal as yours, then noting down the things you like about them. You might also want to engage a reputable design-savvy friend to help you with making design-related decisions. </p>



<p>Take note of crucial things like the website&#8217;s <strong>Loading Speed,</strong> <strong>Content Structure and Hierarchy, Font Choices, Font Sizes and Styles, Colours, Logo Placement, Images e.t.c,</strong> and ensure it strikes a consistency with your brand or business, then ask if the web designer can help you achieve the same thing (by submitting it as a written brief). However, don&#8217;t take their word for it because they&#8217;ll most likely return an affirmative answer. </p>



<p>Now, here is the tricky part; You must verify their claim by cross-checking it against their portfolio (which you must have requested earlier) and look out for that same pattern in their previous works. <strong>Do previous works reflect their claims?</strong> If the answer is a big no, <strong><em>run for your life!</em></strong> But if the answer seems inconclusive, Still, <strong><em>run for your life</em></strong> (or proceed at your own risk). </p>



<p>It has to be a strong <strong>YES</strong>, which means all the website design projects featured on their portfolio must reflect their claims.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Before you hire your next web designer, it is always a good idea to consider the two points above. They would go a long way in saving you from a potentially devastating disappointment. I have intentionally kept this article brief and straightforward so that it is very easy to follow, but if you have a tip that I have missed out, then share with us in the comments below. </p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="709" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Sad-Pablo-Escobar.jpeg" alt="Sad Pablo Escobar" class="wp-image-174" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Sad-Pablo-Escobar.jpeg 720w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Sad-Pablo-Escobar-300x295.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption>MEME: Freelancer Waiting for payment after submitting work.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This article would help you to better manage stubborn clients who do not always want to pay your balance. I&#8217;ll be very brief with my points but I&#8217;ll try to make them as helpful as I can. </p>



<p>I brought this up because I have faced a series of challenges like this in the past, so I thought it&#8217;ll be an interesting discussion, especially for entry-level website designers and developers who seem to be quite inexperienced with the business side of website development.</p>



<p>First off, here are some of the crucial things you should put in place when starting a website design business. </p>



<ol><li>An invoicing system (a.k.a bookkeeping system) with auto-remind feature. </li><li>A business logo, website and corporate email address. </li><li>Basic business sense. </li></ol>



<p>Now let&#8217;s start. </p>



<h2 id="h-1-have-a-payment-policy-and-stand-firm-by-it">1. Have a Payment Policy and stand firm by it.</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll lose some clients and that&#8217;s okay &#8211; Put a very brief summary of this payment policy (or Payment Terms) on your invoice, alongside your banking details. Also ensure that every invoice you send has a due date.</p>



<p>See the example below; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="583" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-10.06.06-PM-1024x583.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 08 16 at 10.06.06 PM" class="wp-image-185" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-10.06.06-PM-1024x583.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-10.06.06-PM-300x171.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-10.06.06-PM-768x437.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-10.06.06-PM-1536x874.png 1536w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-10.06.06-PM.png 1624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Sample Invoice with payment notes/terms.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>2. Write and pubish your Terms of Service </h2>



<p>Create and publish your Terms of Service (ToS) on a dedicated page on your website. You&#8217;ll need to let your client know that by using your service, they&#8217;ve accepted your <strong>Terms of Use</strong>. You may need to redirect them to this ToS page as a reference when they default or abuse those terms. </p>



<p>For your inspiration, <a class="extlink" href="https://branditechture.agency/terms-of-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here is an example.</a> </p>



<h2>3. Declare a Grace Period </h2>



<p>A Grace Period is as important to the client as your balance is to you. A grace period is basically a period in which your customer is allowed to delay payment beyond the agreed due date. During this period, no late fees are charged and the website can still be left to work fully. This period is also an opportunity for you to get a little bit closer to your client in order to show them that you are concerned about their unresponsiveness. I personally give a grace period between 7 and 14 days. </p>



<p>Depending on the client&#8217;s attitude, after the Grace period elapses, you may want to charge them an additional 1% of the balance every day until they make their payment. This can be termed as a <strong>&#8220;Late Fee&#8221;</strong>, which is payable on top of the balance due. But you may keep yours simple and not charge the Late Fee. </p>



<h2>4. Notify them at every stage of their billing cycle. </h2>



<p>Expectedly, every invoice should have a due date appended to it. The due date is the &#8220;maximum date&#8221; when an invoice is expected to be settled.</p>



<p>It is important that you notify the customer at every stage of the billing cycle viz; Due date, grace period and restrictions. This is where invoice auto-reminders can help. You can either schedule the reminders to automatically fire, for example,<em> 3 days before the due date, <em>7 days after the due date,</em></em> <em>etc</em>, or you can do it manually. </p>



<p>I sometimes do mine manually because I love to personalize my tone when communicating with clients. You know,  not all clients are the same. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">TIP: For invoices and reminders, use <em>a</em> mail address like billing@yourwebsite.com or accounting@yourwebsite.com.</pre>



<h2>5. Finally, impose a restriction on their website </h2>



<p>If all your due date reminders and grace period alert are ignored, you should now send them a final email ( or WhatsApp message ) asking about their wellbeing whilst politely informing them that their Grace period has passed and their website has been restricted as a result. It is important to mention that this is their last notice and they may not recieve further alerts from you. </p>



<p>Now, here is the most important part; Do not send them further alerts or notifications after this final notice. I repeat, DO NOT send the customer further alerts after imposing this restriction on their website. Breaking this rule would not only make you look beggy and pitiful, it would also dilute the efficacy of the restriction. </p>



<p>There are two ways to impose a restriction on their website; </p>



<h3>(i.) Use a modified index.html file</h3>



<p>Go to the website root folder and rename their index.php (as in WordPress-based websites) or index.html (found in static html websites) file to something like &#8220;indexxxx.php&#8221; or indexxx.html. The idea is to change the default index.html page. Next, upload this <strong>Website_Suspended.HTML</strong> file in their website root folder (usually named public_html) and rename the <meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Website_Suspended.HTML</strong> file to <strong><em>index.html. </em></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="640" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.23.08-PM-1024x640.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 08 16 at 9.23.08 PM" class="wp-image-172" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.23.08-PM-1024x640.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.23.08-PM-300x188.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.23.08-PM-768x480.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.23.08-PM-1536x960.png 1536w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.23.08-PM-2048x1280.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Screenshot &#8211; Account Suspended </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now, anytime they visit that website through the homepage, it&#8217;ll always serve the new index.html (which is the website suspended HTML page). </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Click <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/branditechture/branditechture.github.io/master/Downloads/Website_Suspended.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>HERE</strong></a> to download the Website_Suspended.HTML file. 
<strong><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">TIP:</span></strong> You may need to manually save it (using Ctrl+S or CMD + S) if it opens as a text. Don't forget to rename the file to index.html before or after uploading.</pre>



<p>I like to use this method with non-techy clients because it&#8217;s very easy to undo once they settle their overdue balance. </p>



<p>The only disadvantage of this method is that the client would still be able to bypass the restriction by accessing their website via its sub directories, e.g https://website.com/subdir.</p>



<p>This should be seen as a soft restriction because it doesn&#8217;t harm their SEO as much, since other pages other than the homepage can still be accessed via the search engine result pages (or SERP). </p>



<h3>(ii.) Put the website in Coming Soon mode </h3>



<p>If you used WordPress, a much easier way would be to install a <strong>Coming Soon</strong> or <strong>Maintenance mode</strong> plugin, and then customize the message to display what you want. You can decide to put ads on it (But I guess that would be too extreme). </p>



<p>This method when used for long periods can send a bad signal to Google (due to the 503 Website Temporarily Unavailable HTTP header), thereby potentially hurting their search engine rankings.</p>



<p>After exhausting all the steps above, it is time to shift your focus to other jobs. </p>



<p>If you follow(ed) these tips religiously, I can assure you that your client would naturally &#8220;concede defeat&#8221; and chase after you with your full balance. It might take weeks or months, but they&#8217;ll almost certainly get back to you with your full balance. </p>



<p>Now, that&#8217;s cool and classy. <img loading="lazy" height="16" width="16" alt="😎" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t22/2/16/1f60e.png"> You&#8217;ve handled a difficult issue the way big businesses do.</p>



<p>The best part? What transpired between you will usually not deter them from contacting you for other projects in the future. In fact, managing the situation using this strategy further proves that you are a professional.  </p>

<p>This might sound like you’re very boring topic but I’m content marketing is actually the future of advertising. People might not tell you this but this is the ultimate budget silver. reasons why content marketing is the best for your business.</p>



<p>&nbsp;content marketing is a new idea for most businesses and because of its long-term strategy and its low turnout a lot of businesses are unwilling to put in their time and effort in it. what makes a multibillion-dollar company?</p>



<p>&nbsp;that is the multibillion-dollar question.&nbsp; what if I told you that by just creating content your value can increase by more than 100% full stop content creation does not really cost you a huge sum of money</p>

<p>I know some big companies who do not pass through due process during the hiring process employee. The disadvantage of this is that the employee the incoming employee is not completely imbibed in the company’s culture which is very dangerous to the future of that contract.</p>
