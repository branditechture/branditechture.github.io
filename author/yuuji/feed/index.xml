<p>There is a growing concern about the level of professionalism in the field of website design and it is becoming quite annoying. In the past, website design used to be an honourable profession and only a few could qualify as a web designer or developer. This is perhaps due to the barriers which were previously associated with accessing web design tools, training, and certifications, but sadly, the industry is now oversaturated with quacks as any Monkey with a laptop and mobile internet access can easily pass for a website designer. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme-1024x768.jpg" alt="Angry Woman and Cat Meme" class="wp-image-232" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme-300x225.jpg 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme-768x576.jpg 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Angry-Woman-and-Cat-Meme.jpg 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>What is the motivation behind this post?</strong></p>



<p>The overwhelming increase in the number of quack web designers on the World Wide Web has now made it very difficult for prospective website owners to avoid playing into the wrong hands. At least, 1 in every 5 website owners fall prey to a quack web designer. That&#8217;s not all — some prospective website owners have been tricked to part ways with their money in exchange for absolutely no value. To this end, I felt the need to do my own part by writing this piece.</p>



<p>I know it is impossible to eradicate this plague, but I want to believe that no one reads these tips and still ends up with a quack.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-request-their-portfolio-and-assess-their-own-website">1. Request their portfolio and assess their own website</h2>



<p>There is no gainsaying that this should be the first thing you should request from any web designer you are looking to hire. However, despite the fact that many people request a portfolio, they still fall prey to quack web designers because they forgot to request their own website. </p>



<p>The most important item on a web designer&#8217;s portfolio is arguably their own website. This is because a quack website designer can easily claim he built any website by just sending you a bunch of web links, but you&#8217;d be more accurate if you judge their capabilities by taking a look at their very own website.  </p>



<p>Take note of the following red flags;</p>



<ul><li>They don&#8217;t have a website.</li><li>They claim their website is under construction.</li><li>Their website loads very slowly.</li><li>Their website lacks content.</li><li>You see some dummy <strong><em>&#8220;Lorem Ipsum&#8221;</em></strong> texts scattered all over the place.</li><li>Unforgivable grammatical errors, both on and off their website.  </li></ul>



<h2 id="h-2-access-yourself-and-prepare-ahead">2. Access yourself and prepare ahead</h2>



<p>As a prospective website owner, it is also important for you to do a personal self-assessment as you are very likely to end up with a quack web designer if one or more of the reasons below apply to you;</p>



<ul><li>You don&#8217;t have an eye for good design.</li><li>You fail to discuss the performance side of your project.</li><li>Your budget is too low.</li><li>You overlook some or all of the red flags.</li></ul>



<p>It is quite simple — before embarking on a search for <a class="extlink" href="https://branditechture.agency/lets-build-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a good web designer,</a> you should at least have some realistic expectations of what you wish to derive from the website in view; both aesthetically and functionally. You can achieve this by browsing through websites that share the same goal as yours, then noting down the things you like about them. You might also want to engage a reputable design-savvy friend to help you with making design-related decisions. </p>



<p>Take note of crucial things like the website&#8217;s <strong>Loading Speed,</strong> <strong>Content Structure and Hierarchy, Font Choices, Font Sizes and Styles, Colours, Logo Placement, Images e.t.c,</strong> and ensure it strikes a consistency with your brand or business, then ask if the web designer can help you achieve the same thing (by submitting it as a written brief). However, don&#8217;t take their word for it because they&#8217;ll most likely return an affirmative answer. </p>



<p>Now, here is the tricky part; You must verify their claim by cross-checking it against their portfolio (which you must have requested earlier) and look out for that same pattern in their previous works. <strong>Do previous works reflect their claims?</strong> If the answer is a big no, <strong><em>run for your life!</em></strong> But if the answer seems inconclusive, Still, <strong><em>run for your life</em></strong> (or proceed at your own risk). </p>



<p>It has to be a strong <strong>YES</strong>, which means all the website design projects featured on their portfolio must reflect their claims.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Before you hire your next web designer, it is always a good idea to consider the two points above. They would go a long way in saving you from a potentially devastating disappointment. I have intentionally kept this article brief and straightforward so that it is very easy to follow, but if you have a tip that I have missed out, then share with us in the comments below. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="709" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Sad-Pablo-Escobar.jpeg" alt="Sad Pablo Escobar" class="wp-image-174" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Sad-Pablo-Escobar.jpeg 720w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Sad-Pablo-Escobar-300x295.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption>MEME: Freelancer Waiting for payment after submitting work.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This article would help you to better manage stubborn clients who do not always want to pay your balance. I&#8217;ll be very brief with my points but I&#8217;ll try to make them as helpful as I can. </p>



<p>I brought this up because I have faced a series of challenges like this in the past, so I thought it&#8217;ll be an interesting discussion, especially for entry-level website designers and developers who seem to be quite inexperienced with the business side of website development.</p>



<p>First off, here are some of the crucial things you should put in place when starting a website design business. </p>



<ol><li>An invoicing system (a.k.a bookkeeping system) with auto-remind feature. </li><li>A business logo, website and corporate email address. </li><li>Basic business sense. </li></ol>



<p>Now let&#8217;s start. </p>



<h2 id="h-1-have-a-payment-policy-and-stand-firm-by-it">1. Have a Payment Policy and stand firm by it.</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll lose some clients and that&#8217;s okay &#8211; Put a very brief summary of this payment policy (or Payment Terms) on your invoice, alongside your banking details. Also ensure that every invoice you send has a due date.</p>



<p>See the example below; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="583" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-10.06.06-PM-1024x583.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 08 16 at 10.06.06 PM" class="wp-image-185" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-10.06.06-PM-1024x583.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-10.06.06-PM-300x171.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-10.06.06-PM-768x437.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-10.06.06-PM-1536x874.png 1536w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-10.06.06-PM.png 1624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Sample Invoice with payment notes/terms.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>2. Write and pubish your Terms of Service </h2>



<p>Create and publish your Terms of Service (ToS) on a dedicated page on your website. You&#8217;ll need to let your client know that by using your service, they&#8217;ve accepted your <strong>Terms of Use</strong>. You may need to redirect them to this ToS page as a reference when they default or abuse those terms. </p>



<p>For your inspiration, <a class="extlink" href="https://branditechture.agency/terms-of-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here is an example.</a> </p>



<h2>3. Declare a Grace Period </h2>



<p>A Grace Period is as important to the client as your balance is to you. A grace period is basically a period in which your customer is allowed to delay payment beyond the agreed due date. During this period, no late fees are charged and the website can still be left to work fully. This period is also an opportunity for you to get a little bit closer to your client in order to show them that you are concerned about their unresponsiveness. I personally give a grace period between 7 and 14 days. </p>



<p>Depending on the client&#8217;s attitude, after the Grace period elapses, you may want to charge them an additional 1% of the balance every day until they make their payment. This can be termed as a <strong>&#8220;Late Fee&#8221;</strong>, which is payable on top of the balance due. But you may keep yours simple and not charge the Late Fee. </p>



<h2>4. Notify them at every stage of their billing cycle. </h2>



<p>Expectedly, every invoice should have a due date appended to it. The due date is the &#8220;maximum date&#8221; when an invoice is expected to be settled.</p>



<p>It is important that you notify the customer at every stage of the billing cycle viz; Due date, grace period and restrictions. This is where invoice auto-reminders can help. You can either schedule the reminders to automatically fire, for example,<em> 3 days before the due date, <em>7 days after the due date,</em></em> <em>etc</em>, or you can do it manually. </p>



<p>I sometimes do mine manually because I love to personalize my tone when communicating with clients. You know,  not all clients are the same. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">TIP: For invoices and reminders, use <em>a</em> mail address like billing@yourwebsite.com or accounting@yourwebsite.com.</pre>



<h2>5. Finally, impose a restriction on their website </h2>



<p>If all your due date reminders and grace period alert are ignored, you should now send them a final email ( or WhatsApp message ) asking about their wellbeing whilst politely informing them that their Grace period has passed and their website has been restricted as a result. It is important to mention that this is their last notice and they may not recieve further alerts from you. </p>



<p>Now, here is the most important part; Do not send them further alerts or notifications after this final notice. I repeat, DO NOT send the customer further alerts after imposing this restriction on their website. Breaking this rule would not only make you look beggy and pitiful, it would also dilute the efficacy of the restriction. </p>



<p>There are two ways to impose a restriction on their website; </p>



<h3>(i.) Use a modified index.html file</h3>



<p>Go to the website root folder and rename their index.php (as in WordPress-based websites) or index.html (found in static html websites) file to something like &#8220;indexxxx.php&#8221; or indexxx.html. The idea is to change the default index.html page. Next, upload this <strong>Website_Suspended.HTML</strong> file in their website root folder (usually named public_html) and rename the <meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Website_Suspended.HTML</strong> file to <strong><em>index.html. </em></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="640" src="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.23.08-PM-1024x640.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021 08 16 at 9.23.08 PM" class="wp-image-172" srcset="https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.23.08-PM-1024x640.png 1024w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.23.08-PM-300x188.png 300w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.23.08-PM-768x480.png 768w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.23.08-PM-1536x960.png 1536w, https://branditechture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-16-at-9.23.08-PM-2048x1280.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Screenshot &#8211; Account Suspended </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now, anytime they visit that website through the homepage, it&#8217;ll always serve the new index.html (which is the website suspended HTML page). </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Click <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/branditechture/branditechture.github.io/master/Downloads/Website_Suspended.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>HERE</strong></a> to download the Website_Suspended.HTML file. 
<strong><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">TIP:</span></strong> You may need to manually save it (using Ctrl+S or CMD + S) if it opens as a text. Don't forget to rename the file to index.html before or after uploading.</pre>



<p>I like to use this method with non-techy clients because it&#8217;s very easy to undo once they settle their overdue balance. </p>



<p>The only disadvantage of this method is that the client would still be able to bypass the restriction by accessing their website via its sub directories, e.g https://website.com/subdir.</p>



<p>This should be seen as a soft restriction because it doesn&#8217;t harm their SEO as much, since other pages other than the homepage can still be accessed via the search engine result pages (or SERP). </p>



<h3>(ii.) Put the website in Coming Soon mode </h3>



<p>If you used WordPress, a much easier way would be to install a <strong>Coming Soon</strong> or <strong>Maintenance mode</strong> plugin, and then customize the message to display what you want. You can decide to put ads on it (But I guess that would be too extreme). </p>



<p>This method when used for long periods can send a bad signal to Google (due to the 503 Website Temporarily Unavailable HTTP header), thereby potentially hurting their search engine rankings.</p>



<p>After exhausting all the steps above, it is time to shift your focus to other jobs. </p>



<p>If you follow(ed) these tips religiously, I can assure you that your client would naturally &#8220;concede defeat&#8221; and chase after you with your full balance. It might take weeks or months, but they&#8217;ll almost certainly get back to you with your full balance. </p>



<p>Now, that&#8217;s cool and classy. <img loading="lazy" height="16" width="16" alt="😎" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t22/2/16/1f60e.png"> You&#8217;ve handled a difficult issue the way big businesses do.</p>



<p>The best part? What transpired between you will usually not deter them from contacting you for other projects in the future. In fact, managing the situation using this strategy further proves that you are a professional.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;content marketing is a new idea for most businesses and because of its long-term strategy and its low turnout a lot of businesses are unwilling to put in their time and effort in it. what makes a multibillion-dollar company?</p>



<p>&nbsp;that is the multibillion-dollar question.&nbsp; what if I told you that by just creating content your value can increase by more than 100% full stop content creation does not really cost you a huge sum of money</p>
